  abstract = {Many domains across physical, life, and social sciences suffer from incomplete models of constructs (e.g., organisms, environments, behaviors), which hinders reproducibility and the pace of discovery. Critically, the prevailing research paradigm, of individuals or small groups working within the resource constraints of their own organization, does little to support model completion and discovery. It does not integrate capabilities, enable investigators to generate data at scale, or offer a path to sharing knowledge at the level of data (versus at the level of conclusions). To develop and deploy a new paradigm for conducting science, The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) created the Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) program. The SD2 program proposed a novel method of conducting science that (1) integrates the capabilities of multiple organizations across multiple domains and (2) makes implicit knowledge explicit at all stages of the scientific process. It assembled and integrated a sociotechnical system that aimed to overcome the limitations of conventional scientific methods. In this paradigm, scientists and technologists collaborated to develop technologies, share data, and conduct science in ways that were faster, more efficient, more complete, and more productive than was possible outside of this program. This paper describes the SD2 approach to developing that sociotechnical system---of selectively applying conventional methods of science, embracing a more collaborative paradigm, and establishing an infrastructure---to drive discovery.},

The recent growth of data science and automated experimentation techniques has resulted in the advent of self-driving labs (SDLs) via the integration of machine learning, lab automation and robotics. An SDL is a machine-learning-assisted modular experimental platform that iteratively operates a series of experiments selected by the machine learning algorithm to achieve a user-defined objective. These intelligent robotic assistants help researchers to accelerate the pace of fundamental and applied research through rapid exploration of the chemical space. In this Review, we introduce SDLs and provide a roadmap for their implementation by non-expert scientists. We present the status quo of successful SDL implementations in the field and discuss their current limitations and future opportunities to accelerate finding solutions for societal needs.},

Software tools for this task would facilitate downstream applications such as reaction prediction and condition recommendation. In this study, we fine-tune a large language model (LLM) to extract reaction information from organic synthesis procedure text into structured data following the Open Reaction Database (ORD) schema, a comprehensive data structure designed for organic reactions. The fine-tuned model produces syntactically correct ORD records with an average accuracy of 91.25\% for ORD ``messages'' (e.g., full compound, workups, or condition definitions) and 92.25\% for individual data fields (e.g., compound identifiers, mass quantities), with the ability to recognize compound-referencing tokens and to infer reaction roles.

  abstract = {Synthetic polymers are versatile and widely used materials. Similar to small organic molecules, a large chemical space of such materials is hypothetically accessible. Computational property prediction and virtual screening can accelerate polymer design by prioritizing candidates expected to have favorable properties. However, in contrast to organic molecules, polymers are often not well-defined single structures but an ensemble of similar molecules, which poses unique challenges to traditional chemical representations and machine learning approaches. Here, we introduce a graph representation of molecular ensembles and an associated graph neural network architecture that is tailored to polymer property prediction. We demonstrate that this approach captures critical features of polymeric materials, like chain architecture, monomer stoichiometry, and degree of polymerization, and achieves superior accuracy to off-the-shelf cheminformatics methodologies. While doing so, we built a dataset of simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for {$>$}40k polymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain architecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine learning approaches. The dataset and machine learning models presented in this work pave the path toward new classes of algorithms for polymer informatics and, more broadly, introduce a framework for the modeling of molecular ensembles.},

Some degree of molecular complexity likely had to be supplied by environmental processes to produce entailed self-replicating processes. The origin of entailment, therefore, must connect to fundamental chemistry that builds molecular complexity. We present here an open-source chemoinformatic workflow to model abiological chemistry to discover such entailment. This pipeline automates generation of chemical reaction networks and their analysis to discover novel compounds and autocatalytic processes. We demonstrate this pipeline's capabilities against a well-studied model system by vetting it against experimental data. This workflow can enable rapid identification of products of complex chemistries and their underlying synthetic relationships to help identify autocatalysis, and potentially self-organization, in such systems. The algorithms used in this study are open-source and reconfigurable by other user-developed workflows.},

However, the synthesis of chemical matter often represents a time-consuming and labour-intensive bottleneck. We demonstrate how machine learning methods trained on high-throughput experimentation (HTE) data can be leveraged to enable fast reaction condition selection for novel coupling partners. We show that the trained models support chemists in determining suitable catalyst-solvent-base combinations for individual transformations including an evaluation of the need for HTE screening. We introduce an algorithm for designing 96-well plates optimized towards reaction yields and discuss the model performance of zero- and few-shot machine learning. The best-performing machine learning model achieved a three-category classification accuracy of 76.3\% ({\textpm}0.2\%) and an F1-score for a binary classification of 79.1\% ({\textpm}0.9\%). Validation on eight reactions revealed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) value of 0.82 ({\textpm}0.07) for few-shot machine learning. On the other hand, zero-shot machine learning models achieved a mean ROC-AUC value of 0.63 ({\textpm}0.16). This study positively advocates the application of few-shot machine learning-guided reaction condition selection for HTE campaigns in medicinal chemistry and highlights practical applications as well as challenges associated with zero-shot machine learning.},

This iterative process, which relies heavily on information sharing, is crucial in pharmaceutical development, where drug candidates are transformed into commercially viable Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), impacting the access to medicines for billions of people. In this work, we demonstrate that by capturing chemical pathway ideas digitally, at the point of conception, we can systematically merge these ideas with synthetic knowledge derived from predictive algorithms. This serves as a preliminary step for further route evaluation. To achieve this, we introduce a new method for storing, analysing, and displaying chemical information using graph databases and graph representations, illustrated with the commercial synthesis planning of the GLP-1 inhibitor Lotiglipron. Compared to traditional methods, graph databases naturally fit the substrate-arrow-product model traditionally used by chemists, offering a modern alternative to store and access chemical knowledge. This framework facilitates a universal chemistry approach, allowing to share and combine data from many different sources and organisations, and enabling new ways to optimise the complete route selection process.},

In the rapid advances being made towards self-driving laboratories, automation and autonomy techniques are often convoluted due to similarities between them and ambiguous language, leaving the trade-offs between them overlooked. In this perspective, we address differences between making a process occur without human intervention (automation) and providing agency and flexibility in action (autonomy). We describe the challenges of autonomy in terms of (1) orchestration, how tasks are organized and coordinated; (2) facilitation, how devices are connected and brought under automated control; and (3) scripting languages, how workflows are encoded into digital representations. Autonomous systems require advanced control architectures to handle a reactive, evolving workflow, involving control abstractions and scheduling beyond what current automation approaches provide. The specification of an autonomous system requires goal-oriented commands and context awareness, whereas automation needs exact, unambiguous instructions for reproducibility and efficiency. We contend that this contrast in design creates a need for improved standards in automation and a set of guiding principles to facilitate the development of autonomy-enabling technologies.},

  abstract = {The chemical and reaction spaces are incredibly vast and special procedures are required to study them. Their complex and multiparametric nature encompass myriads of compounds and interactions and endless modifications involving the distinct impact of relevant variables (temperature, solvent, stoichiometry, etc.). This often calls for the design, collection, and analysis/interpretation of large datasets. Reaction charting, the systematic scanning, description, analysis, and guided modifications of a given process, stands as the most promising approach. It offers fast and accurate solutions as well as expanding the knowledge about the systems. This deeper understanding enables reliable predictions, improvement of the productivity (yields, scope), eventually leading to sustainable, economic, and safe applications.

Or a sketch ID, which could be your ideation page that involves 20 compounds - you'll be able to see 20 events together. And so on. This abstraction makes it universal - whoever owns Meve defines what an Event is, which events they are interested in, the granularity at which to group them (the context), etc. This allows anyone (be it a person or another software) find anything happening to a compound.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed in asymmetric catalysis to predict reaction outcomes and optimize enantioselective processes. Despite the trend of expanding data set sizes to improve model performance, asymmetric catalysis presents unique challenges, including the difficulty of acquiring high-quality experimental data and the often-limited availability of structurally diverse examples. Consequently, rational data set design requires the practitioner to choose whether to collect data that maximizes diversity in the training set or data that maximizes representation around a target prediction. A key challenge in these studies is understanding the role of local reaction space-specifically, how much predictive accuracy is driven by nearest neighbors (structurally and electronically similar data points) and the next-nearest neighbors? This study investigates the predictive power of ML models trained with varying levels of local representation in the reaction space. We provide a framework, a radius-based random forest (RaRF) algorithm, to systematically probe the effects of including diverse reactions dissimilar to a target prediction. We show that when the training set is representative of the target reaction, the gains from increasing data set diversity are modest-typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol in predictive error-and increasing to only 0.5 kcal/mol for extrapolative tests, highlighting the need for targeted data set design. Furthermore, these findings hold even for complex architectures and features. Finally, we demonstrate that a targeted, neighborhood-oriented strategy greatly accelerates the identification of predictive models compared to diversity-driven approaches.},

The revolution started with models able to address specific tasks with a single type of data, like linearised molecular graphs, which then evolved to include other types of data, like spectra from analytical instruments, synthesis actions, and human language. A new trend leverages recent developments in large language models, giving rise to a wave of models capable of solving generic tasks in chemistry, all facilitated by the flexibility of natural language. As we continue to explore and harness these capabilities, we can look forward to a future where machine learning plays an even more integral role in accelerating drug discovery.},

There has been a growing interest in applying deep learning to several subfields, including the digital transformation of synthetic chemistry, extraction of chemical information from the scientific literature, and AI in natural product-based drug discovery. The application of AI to molecular informatics is still constrained by the fact that most of the data used for training and testing deep learning models are not available as FAIR and open data. As open science practices continue to grow in popularity, initiatives which support FAIR and open data as well as open-source software have emerged. It is becoming increasingly important for researchers in the field of molecular informatics to embrace open science and to submit data and software in open repositories. With the advent of open-source deep learning frameworks and cloud computing platforms, academic researchers are now able to deploy and test their own deep learning models with ease. With the development of new and faster hardware for deep learning and the increasing number of initiatives towards digital research data management infrastructures, as well as a culture promoting open data, open source, and open science, AI-driven molecular informatics will continue to grow.

The goal of our perspective is three-fold. We first provide historical context for the explosive growth of modern simulation-based techniques, with interesting parallels to the development of modern scientific thought. We next discuss the three short vignettes from our own research that illuminated us into appreciating computation. Finally, we propose several calls to action for the scientific community to better advocate for computation.

  abstract = {Plasma medicine has attracted tremendous interest in a variety of medical conditions, ranging from wound healing to antimicrobial applications, even in cancer treatment, through the interactions of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) and various biological tissues directly or indirectly. The underlying mechanisms of CAP treatment are still poorly understood although the oxidative effects of CAP with amino acids, peptides, and proteins have been explored experimentally. In this study, machine learning (ML) technology is introduced to efficiently unveil the interaction mechanisms of amino acids and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in seconds based on the data obtained from the reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are performed to probe the interaction of five types of amino acids with various ROS on the timescale of hundreds of picoseconds but with the huge computational load of several days. The oxidative reactions typically start with H-abstraction, and the details of the breaking and formation of chemical bonds are revealed; the modification types, such as nitrosylation, hydroxylation, and carbonylation, can be observed. The dose effects of ROS are also investigated by varying the number of ROS in the simulation box, indicating agreement with the experimental observation. To overcome the limits of timescales and the size of molecular systems in reactive MD simulations, a deep neural network (DNN) with five hidden layers is constructed according to the reaction data and employed to predict the type of oxidative modification and the probability of occurrence only in seconds as the dose of ROS varies. The well-trained DNN can effectively and accurately predict the oxidative processes and productions, which greatly improves the computational efficiency by almost ten orders of magnitude compared with the reactive MD simulation. This study shows the great potential of ML technology to efficiently unveil the underpinning mechanisms in plasma medicine based on the data from reactive MD simulations or experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {This paper presents AutoTemplate, an innovative data preprocessing protocol, addressing the crucial need for high-quality chemical reaction datasets in the realm of machine learning applications in organic chemistry. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. However, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants, incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. AutoTemplate introduces a two-stage approach to refine these datasets. The first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction templates using a simplified SMARTS representation. This simplification broadens the applicability of templates across various chemical reactions. The second stage is template-guided reaction curation, where these templates are systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. This process effectively amends missing reactant information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. A standout feature of AutoTemplate is its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. It operates on the premise that most reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. The protocol demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. This advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. AutoTemplate marks a significant progression in the preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine learning applications in organic synthesis.},

This work introduces an innovative deep learning approach designed to address the complex task of predicting appropriate reagents, solvents, and reaction temperatures for chemical reactions. Our proposed methodology combines a multi-label classification model with a ranking model to offer tailored reaction condition recommendations based on relevance scores derived from anticipated product yields. To tackle the challenge of limited data for unfavorable reaction contexts, we employed the technique of hard negative sampling to generate reaction conditions that might be mistakenly classified as suitable, forcing the model to refine its decision boundaries, especially in challenging cases. Our developed model excels in proposing conditions where an exact match to the recorded solvents and reagents is found within the top-10 predictions 73\% of the time. It also predicts temperatures within  {\textpm}~20 {$^\circ$}C of the recorded temperature in 89\% of test cases. Notably, the model demonstrates its capacity to recommend multiple viable reaction conditions, with accuracy varying based on the availability of condition records associated with each reaction. What sets this model apart is its ability to suggest alternative reaction conditions beyond the constraints of the dataset. This underscores its potential to inspire innovative approaches in chemical research, presenting a compelling opportunity for advancing chemical synthesis planning and elevating the field of reaction engineering.},

G2Retro imitates the reversed logic of synthetic reactions. It first predicts the reaction centers in the target molecules (products), identifies the synthons needed to assemble the products, and transforms these synthons into reactants. G2Retro defines a comprehensive set of reaction center types, and learns from the molecular graphs of the products to predict potential reaction centers. To complete synthons into reactants, G2Retro considers all the involved synthon structures and the product structures to identify the optimal completion paths, and accordingly attaches small substructures sequentially to the synthons. Here we show that G2Retro is able to better predict the reactants for given products in the benchmark dataset than the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {The interdisciplinary field of chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) is an active area of research aimed at accelerating scientific discovery. Large language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in biochemical tasks, especially the molecule caption translation, which aims to align between molecules and natural language texts. However, existing works mainly focus on single molecules, while alignment between chemical reactions and natural language text remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the description of reactions is an essential part in biochemical patents and literature, and research on this aspect not only can help better understand chemical reactions but also promote research on automating chemical synthesis and retrosynthesis. In this work, we propose {\textbackslash}textbf\{ReactGPT\}, a framework aiming to bridge the gap between chemical reaction and text. ReactGPT allows a new task: reaction captioning, by adapting LLMs to learn reaction-text alignment from context examples via In-Context Tuning. Specifically, ReactGPT jointly leverages a Fingerprints-based Reaction Retrieval module, a Domain-Specific Prompt Design module, and a two-stage In-Context Tuning module. We evaluate the effectiveness of ReactGPT on reaction captioning and experimental procedure prediction, both of these tasks can reflect the understanding of chemical reactions. Experimental results show that compared to previous models, ReactGPT exhibits competitive capabilities in resolving chemical reactions and generating high-quality text with correct structure.},

  abstract = {Databases contain millions of reactions for compound synthesis, rendering selection of reactions for forward synthetic design of small molecule screening libraries, such as DNA-encoded libraries (DELs), a big data challenge. To support reaction space navigation, we developed the computational workflow Reaction Navigator. Reaction files from a large chemistry database were processed using the open-source KNIME Analytics Platform. Initial processing steps included a customizable filtering cascade that removed reactions with a high probability to be incompatible with DEL, as they would e.g. damage the genetic barcode, to arrive at a comprehensive list of transformations for DEL design with applicability potential. These reactions were displayed and clustered by user-defined molecular reaction descriptors which are independent of reaction core substitution patterns. Thanks to clustering, these can be searched manually to identify reactions for DEL synthesis according to desired reaction criteria, such as ring formation or sp3 content. The workflow was initially applied for mapping chemical reaction space for aromatic aldehydes as an exemplary functional group often used in DEL synthesis. Exemplary reactions have been successfully translated to DNA-tagged substrates and can be applied to library synthesis. The versatility of the Reaction Navigator was then shown by mapping reaction space for different reaction conditions, for amines as a second set of starting materials, and for data from a second database.},

Implementation gaps hinder the widespread adoption of digital chemistry among the scientific community. Automated protocols can save significant time and effort, minimize human errors, and make digital protocols more accessible. Cheminformatics tools can automate multiple tasks in computational chemistry. In machine learning, automation facilitates protocols such as data curation, algorithm screening, testing of models, and predictor generation. Abstract The rapid progress of digital chemistry has profoundly transformed chemical research. Despite this evolution, there are implementation gaps that hinder the widespread adoption of such digital protocols among a significant portion of the chemistry community. For example, technologies such as computational chemistry and machine learning often present steep learning curves that discourage potential users who could otherwise benefit from them. This review focuses on classical and recent advances in the automation and generalization of digital chemistry, examining the evolution of the field while highlighting popular cheminformatics tools. We elaborate on efforts from different groups in automating quantum chemistry and machine learning workflows, with the goal of bridging implementation gaps and making these technologies accessible to the broader chemistry community.

Most interpretations of genomic analyses rely on accurate functional annotations of the proteins encoded by more than 500\,000 genomes sequenced to date. By different estimates, only half the predicted sequenced proteins carry an accurate functional annotation, and this percentage varies drastically between different organismal lineages. Such a large gap in knowledge hampers all aspects of biological enterprise and, thereby, is standing in the way of genomic biology reaching its full potential. A brainstorming meeting to address this issue funded by the National Science Foundation was held during 3--4 February 2022. Bringing together data scientists, biocurators, computational biologists and experimentalists within the same venue allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the current state of functional annotations of protein families.

  abstract = {Chemical reactions are central for the creation of new materials, drug design and many more fields. Obtaining high reaction yields is of great importance to reduce cost and increase the efficiency and purity of the obtained product. To reduce the number of experiments for high reaction yield screening in organic chemistry, the use of active learning (AL) is an interesting approach. Unfortunately, the majority of AL is based on ``retro-AL'' where all the reactions are already available. One problem of ``real-time'' AL is determining when to stop the AL loop without creating an external labeled test set to analyze the performance of the model. The stopping procedure presented in this work is a stopping criterion, namely the stabilization prediction (SP) (Bloodgood et al., Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, 2009, 39--47). It uses an unlabeled equivalent of a test set called a stop set to indirectly evaluate the accuracy of the AL loop. To benchmark the stability of this method and investigate its applicability in chemistry, two datasets from the organic literature, four estimators, three types of descriptors, two sizes of queries per iteration (QPI) and stop set size were investigated. We determine that the present method is the most stable with a Support Vector Classification (SVC) estimator, 50 QPI and a stop set size containing 30\% of the data. It produces the best compromise between an early stop (consumes less than 50\% of the data) and a reliable accuracy over 10 different runs compared to the accuracy obtained with classical supervised machine learning. We do hope that this method would be of use to create ``real-time'' AL in chemistry.},

This observation can be attributed to several factors including, but not limited to, pest resistance, lack of novelty with respect to modes of action or classes of chemistry, and regulatory action. Due to current and projected increases of the global population, it is evident that the demand for food, and consequently, the usage of pesticides to improve yields will increase. Addressing these challenges and needs while promoting new crop protection agents through an increasingly stringent regulatory landscape requires the development and integration of infrastructures for innovative, cost- and time-effective discovery and development of novel and sustainable molecules. Significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and cheminformatics over the last two decades have improved the decision-making power of research scientists in the discovery of bioactive molecules. AI- and cheminformatics-driven molecule discovery offers the opportunity of moving experiments from the greenhouse to a virtual environment where thousands to billions of molecules can be investigated at a rapid pace, providing unbiased hypothesis for lead generation, optimization, and effective suggestions for compound synthesis and testing. To date, this is illustrated to a far lesser extent in the publicly available agrochemical research literature compared to drug discovery. In this review, we provide an overview of the crop protection discovery pipeline and how traditional, cheminformatics, and AI technologies can help to address the needs and challenges of agrochemical discovery towards rapidly developing novel and more sustainable products.},

Most importantly, all databases contain nearly only data from batch processes [4]. Since conditions in continuous-flow processes are substantially different from batch, the current data resources can hardly be applied by flow chemists. In this work, chemical reaction data is extracted from all flow chemistry papers available on Web of Science, until 2022. The trends in the flow chemistry database are compared with data available in current reaction databases, in terms of reactants, product types, reaction classes, and reagents.

  abstract = {The challenge of devising pathways for organic synthesis remains a central issue in the field of medicinal chemistry. Over the span of six decades, computer-aided synthesis planning has given rise to a plethora of potent tools for formulating synthetic routes. Nevertheless, a significant expert task still looms: determining the appropriate solvent, catalyst, and reagents when provided with a set of reactants to achieve and optimize the desired product for a specific step in the synthesis process. Typically, chemists identify key functional groups and rings that exert crucial influences at the reaction center, classify reactions into categories, and may assign them names. This research introduces Rxn-INSIGHT, an open-source algorithm based on the bond-electron matrix approach, with the purpose of automating this endeavor. Rxn-INSIGHT not only streamlines the process but also facilitates extensive querying of reaction databases, effectively replicating the thought processes of an organic chemist. The core functions of the algorithm encompass the classification and naming of reactions, extraction of functional groups, rings, and scaffolds from the involved chemical entities. The provision of reaction condition recommendations based on the similarity and prevalence of reactions eventually arises as a side application. The performance of our rule-based model has been rigorously assessed against a carefully curated benchmark dataset, exhibiting an accuracy rate exceeding 90\% in reaction classification and surpassing 95\% in reaction naming. Notably, it has been discerned that a pivotal factor in selecting analogous reactions lies in the analysis of ring structures participating in the reactions. An examination of ring structures within the USPTO chemical reaction database reveals that with just 35 unique rings, a remarkable 75\% of all rings found in nearly 1 million products can be encompassed. Furthermore, Rxn-INSIGHT is proficient in suggesting appropriate choices for solvents, catalysts, and reagents in entirely novel reactions, all within the span of a second, utilizing nothing more than an everyday laptop.},

  abstract = {Chemistry is experiencing a paradigm shift in the way it interacts with data. So-called ``big data'' are collected and used at unprecedented scales with the idea that algorithms can be designed to aid in chemical discovery. As data-enabled practices become ever more ubiquitous, chemists must consider the organization and curation of their data, especially as it is presented to both humans and increasingly intelligent algorithms. One of the most promising organizational schemes for big data is a construct termed an ontology. In data science, ontologies are systems that represent relations among objects and properties in a domain of discourse. As chemistry encounters larger and larger data sets, the ontologies that support chemical research will likewise increase in complexity, and the future of chemistry will be shaped by the choices made in developing big data chemical ontologies. How such ontologies will work should therefore be a subject of significant attention in the chemical community. Now is the time for chemists to ask questions about ontology design and use: How should chemical data be organized? What can be reasonably expected from an organizational structure? Is a universal ontology tenable? As some of these questions may be new to chemists, we recommend an interdisciplinary approach that draws on the long history of philosophers of science asking questions about the organization of scientific concepts, constructs, models, and theories. This Perspective presents insights from these long-standing studies and initiates new conversations between chemists and philosophers.},

In recent years, Geometric Graph Neural Networks have emerged as the preferred machine learning architecture powering applications ranging from protein structure prediction to molecular simulations and material generation. Their specificity lies in the inductive biases they leverage - such as physical symmetries and chemical properties - to learn informative representations of these geometric graphs. In this opinionated paper, we provide a comprehensive and self-contained overview of the field of Geometric GNNs for 3D atomic systems. We cover fundamental background material and introduce a pedagogical taxonomy of Geometric GNN architectures: (1) invariant networks, (2) equivariant networks in Cartesian basis, (3) equivariant networks in spherical basis, and (4) unconstrained networks. Additionally, we outline key datasets and application areas and suggest future research directions.

  abstract = {The modern technological landscape has trended towards increased precision and greater digitization of information. However, the methods used to record and communicate scientific procedures have remained largely unchanged over the last century. Written text as the primary means for communicating scientific protocols poses notable limitations in human and machine information transfer. In this work, we present the Universal Workflow Language (UWL) and the open-source Universal Workflow Language interface (UWLi). UWL is a graph-based data architecture that can capture arbitrary scientific procedures through workflow representation of protocol steps and embedded procedure metadata. It is machine readable, discipline agnostic, and compatible with FAIR reporting standards. UWLi is an accompanying software package for building and manipulating UWL files into tabular and plain text representations in a controlled, detailed, and multilingual format. UWL transcription of protocols from three high-impact publications resulted in the identification of substantial deficiencies in the detail of the reported procedures. UWL transcription of these publications identified seventeen procedural ambiguities and thirty missing parameters for every one hundred words in published procedures. In addition to preventing and identifying procedural omission, UWL files were found to be compatible with geometric learning techniques for representing scientific protocols. In a surrogate function designed to represent an arbitrary multi-step experimental process, graph transformer networks were able to predict outcomes in approximately 6,000 fewer experiments than equivalent linear models. Implementation of UWL and UWLi into the scientific reporting process will result in higher reproducibility between both experimentalists and machines, thus proving an avenue to more effective modeling and control of complex systems.},

In Part II, I explore the use of reinforcement learning and multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization for accelerating feedback controller tuning, specifically for distillation control systems. Finally, in Part III, I take two perspectives on using machine learning for predictive thermodynamics, a key aspect of process modelling. I introduce *DeepGamma* for predicting activity coefficients and ML-SAFT for predicting PCP-SAFT parameters, showing steps towards improving thermodynamic predictions using transfer learning.

However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. In this study, we leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the rational design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions due to their electron-ccepting properties. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio computed features and substituent-based parameters derived from the Hammett linear free-energy relationship. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions (mean absolute error {$<$} 6 kJ/mol), surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regimes. Interpretability analyses of the models shed light on the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it through the nature and positioning of substituents on the molecular scaffold. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.},

In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as chemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule generation. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical reactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed hyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction classification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph (DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG transformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the Directed Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of the interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph thanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many desirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being positive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a spectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction datasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing approaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average relative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01\%, with a maximum improvement of 37.71\%.},

Despite their significance, finding suitable reaction conditions leading to a high yield, for instance, remains a challenging and time-consuming task which usually requires screening over many sets of conditions. To help select promising reaction conditions in the vast space of reagent combinations, machine learning is an emerging technique with a lot of promise. In this work, we assess whether the reaction yield of C--N couplings can be predicted from databases of chemical reactions. We test the generalizability of models both on challenging data splits and on a dedicated experimental test set. We find that, provided the chemical space represented by the training set is not left, the models perform well. However, the applicability domain is quickly left even for simple reactions of the same type, as, for instance, present in our plate test set. The results show that yield prediction for new reactions is possible from the algorithmic side but in practice is hindered by the available data. Most importantly, more data that cover the diversity in reagents are needed for a general-purpose prediction of reaction yields. Our findings also expose a challenge to this field in that it appears to be extremely deceiving to judge models based on literature data with test sets which are split off the same literature data, even when challenging splits are considered.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has become indispensable in organic chemistry for optimizing synthetic processes, elucidating reaction mechanisms, and predicting reactivity. The ability of ML to analyze obscure patterns and generate predictive models, coupled with the large-scale dataset generation that can be accomplished via high-throughput experimentation (HTE), can prove valuable for gaining a deeper understanding of chemical reactivity. Despite its potential, several key challenges remain for application of ML in organic chemistry, including: modeling of mechanistically ambiguous or substrate-dependent reactions, for which traditional mechanistic studies may be challenging; and modeling of reactions with strong interaction effects, wherein different substrates exhibit varying sensitivities to changes in reaction conditions.To explore the first challenge, we investigated the highly substrate-dependent Chan-Evans-Lam (CEL) coupling. Through the design and application of an unsupervised learning workflow, we systematically selected diverse substrates for high-throughput data collection and modeling, resulting in a dataset of 3,552 reactions. This diverse dataset allowed for the identification of broadly applicable conditions for the CEL coupling of primary sulfonamides. We found that larger datasets or different featurization techniques may be necessary to achieve high accuracy in yield regression modeling. Nevertheless, a regression model was successfully able to predict the yield of out-of-sample substrates with errors within experimental uncertainty; close inspection of poorly predicted substrates allowed us to put forth hypotheses for the model's shortcomings. We also explored the challenge of modeling interaction effects. Study of a simulated high-throughput experimentation dataset revealed that irrelevant features pose a significant obstacle to learning interaction effects with common ML algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a two-part statistical modeling approach: classical analysis of variance to identify systematic effects that impact yield, followed by regression of individual effects using chemistry-informed features. Applying this methodology to a published alcohol deoxyfluorination dataset enhanced our understanding of interaction dynamics and ultimately resulted in a more accurate and generalizable model. Taken together, these studies offer insights into the CEL coupling of primary sulfonamides and alcohol deoxyfluorination with sulfonyl fluorides. Furthermore, they offer valuable data science tools for modeling organic chemistry datasets and guidelines for dataset design in future studies.},

Designing high-performance HEDMs involves conflicting sub-objectives for molecular structure design. Previous research has focused on specific molecule types, limiting the understanding of molecular structural features' influence on density. This work integrated the structure and density data of C2--C30 oxygen-containing compounds, expanded molecule types, and constructed a comprehensive database with 17,987 compounds' SMILES and density values. Substructures such as ring frameworks, side chains, and functional groups were split using a molecular substructure splitting algorithm. A linear regression model was then established to examine the effects of substructures on density, with regression coefficients representing their contributions. The results showed that ring structures had a greater contribution to density. A decrease in C atoms and an increase in O atoms and their unsaturated bonds were significant positive features of density contribution in ring structures. Side chains and single alkane ring frameworks had similar density contribution distributions, and ring aromatic structures with three or more rings and cycloalkane structures with four or more rings had similar density contribution distributions, with {$\sim$}90\% showing a significant positive contribution. Finally, the study examined the effects of the number of atoms in the skeleton of multi-ring alkane substructures and the average number of shared atoms on density contribution. The significant contribution of multi-ring alkane substructures first increased and then decreased when the average number of atoms in the ring and the variance of the number of atoms increased.},

Herein, we consider chemical language representations for reactions to tap into the potential of natural language processing models such as the ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine Tuning) for yield prediction, which is customized to work across such distribution settings. We contribute a new reaction dataset with more than 860 manually curated reactions collected from literature spanning over a decade, belonging to a family of catalytic meta-C(sp2)-H bond activation reactions of high contemporary importance. Taking cognizance of the dataset size, skewness toward the higher yields, and the sparse distribution characteristics, we developed a new (i) time- and resource-efficient pre-training strategy for downstream transfer learning, and (ii) the CFR (classification followed by regression) model that offers state-of-the-art yield predictions, surpassing conventional direct regression (DR) approaches. Instead of the prevailing pre-training practice of using a large number of unlabeled molecules (1.4 million) from the ChEMBL dataset, we first created a pre-training dataset SSP1 (0.11 million), by using a substructure-based mining from the PubChem database, which is found to be equally effective and more time-efficient in offering enhanced performance. The CFR model with the ULMFiT-SSP1 regressor achieved an impressive RMSE of 8.40 for the CFR-major and 6.48 for the CFR-minor class in yield prediction on the title reaction, with a class boundary of yield at 53 \%. Furthermore, the CFR model is highly generalizable as evidenced by the significant improvement over the previous benchmark reaction datasets.},

Their well-defined nature allows atomically precise control of their properties to potentially match the performance of commercially used organometallic catalysts. The improved metal recovery and reusability enabled through using solid catalysts pave the way for process intensification and minimized work-up in downstream operations. Process optimization requires tailoring the reaction environment, which can cause loss of structural stability, leading to deactivation. The structural and mechanistic understanding provided by computational and experimental interrogation can guide the design and development of next-generation catalysts. Abstract Single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) incorporating isolated metal centers on solid supports demonstrate promise for improving the sustainability of commercial organic transformations. They avoid the issues of metal recovery and reuse associated with conventionally applied organometallic precious metal complexes while delivering highly selective and stable performance. Considering the broad reaction scope of SACs, in this review we explore the potential for activating specific low-energy pathways through tailoring the chemical environment of the active metal for chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective applications while ensuring full accessibility of metal centers. Opportunities and challenges towards their mechanistic understanding and technical implementation, including the influence of the reaction environment, deactivation pathways, and the need for improved sustainability metrics, are discussed.

We introduce Automated Chemical Design (ACD) Levels to clearly define the level of autonomy along the axes of ideation and decision making. To fully illustrate this framework, we provide literature exemplars and place some notable methods and applications into the levels. The ACD framework provides a common language for describing automated small molecule design systems and enables medicinal chemists to better understand and evaluate such systems.},

Here, we express the task of iteratively breaking down a compound into building blocks as a sequence-modeling problem and train a model based on the Decision Transformer. The synthesis routes are generated by iteratively predicting chemical reactions from a set of predefined rules that encode known transformations, and routes are scored during construction using a novel reward function. RetroSynFormer was trained on routes extracted from the PaRoutes dataset of patented experimental routes. On targets from the PaRoutes test set, the RetroSynFormer could find routes to commercial starting materials for 92\% of the targets, and we show that the produced routes on average are close to the reference patented route and of good quality. Furthermore, we explore alternative model implementations and discuss the robustness of the model with respect to beam width, reward function, and template space size. We also compare RetroSynFormer to AiZynthFinder, a conventional retrosynthesis algorithm, and find that our novel model is competitive and complementary to established methodology, thus forming a valuable addition to the field of computer-aided synthesis planning.},

  abstract = {Reaction optimization is challenging and traditionally delegated to domain experts who iteratively propose increasingly optimal experiments. Problematically, the reaction landscape is complex and often requires hundreds of experiments to reach convergence, representing an enormous resource sink. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an optimization algorithm that recommends the next experiment based on previous observations and has recently gained considerable interest in the general chemistry community. The application of BO for chemical reactions has been demonstrated to increase efficiency in optimization campaigns and can recommend favorable reaction conditions amidst many possibilities. Moreover, its ability to jointly optimize desired objectives such as yield and stereoselectivity makes it an attractive alternative or at least complementary to domain expert-guided optimization. With the democratization of BO software, the barrier of entry to applying BO for chemical reactions has drastically lowered. The intersection between the paradigms will see advancements at an ever-rapid pace. In this review, we discuss how chemical reactions can be transformed into machine-readable formats which can be learned by machine learning (ML) models. We present a foundation for BO and how it has already been applied to optimize chemical reaction outcomes. The important message we convey is that realizing the full potential of ML-augmented reaction optimization will require close collaboration between experimentalists and computational scientists.},

  abstract = {Optimization of synthetic reactions represents a crucial step in expediting the exploration of innovative pharmaceuticals and materials, serving as an indispensable tool. To achieve a newly designed molecular structure that meets the desired properties, the optimization process involves skillfully navigating through diverse parameters associated with experimental conditions. Rapid identification of optimal reaction conditions stands as a pivotal element in mitigating the protracted cycle of discovering new drugs and materials. Given the substantial financial expenses, time investment, and specialized expertise required for synthetic experiments, it becomes imperative to minimize the developmental timeline effectively. However, despite the need for expedited exploration of suitable reaction conditions, there are several limitations to consider. Traditionally, the search for best conditional combinations has involved using design of experiment that require searching various literature sources. These approaches can be somewhat passive and inefficient, relying heavily on the knowledge and experience of synthesis researchers. Furthermore, machine learning models that predict reaction conditions solely based on three-dimensional molecular structure information have their own limitations, as the selection of appropriate representation and the consideration of condition compatibility are not clearly defined. Lastly, quantifying the difficulties associated with synthetic processes is crucial for optimizing strategies, yet it remains a challenging task. In the present doctoral dissertation, I put forth a proposition to address the trade-off quandary in chemical reaction optimization. This proposal entails a fusion of machine learning methodologies and Bayesian optimization techniques, leveraging accumulated experimental data. The objective is to efficiently delineate the search space, gauge the complexity of experiments, devise an optimization strategy, and dynamically integrate the outcomes of iterative experiments into the strategy. The primary goal of this study is to significantly diminish the search domain for optimization while quantifying the synthesis level, thereby facilitating the guidance of efficient optimization strategies. The first focal point of this research aims to efficiently narrow down the extensive array of conditions that need to be explored to align with the input reactions and structural information of the compound. Given the impracticality of conducting experiments on the vast number of potential combinations of synthesis conditions, I propose the use of a generative model that utilizes a graph-based representation of the input synthesis reaction and incorporates three-dimensional molecular structure details. This model generates diverse sets of condition combinations within a specified range, while considering the interdependencies among the conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rank candidates solely based on input reaction information, the proposed model incorporates a variational auto-encoder to learn the compatibility between conditions. Consequently, it enables the prediction of diverse yet accurate condition combinations, effectively avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant or meaningless combinations. The second aspect of this study aims to predict the yield of a chemical synthesis reaction while also accounting for the uncertainty associated with the prediction outcomes. Additionally, it involves generating a graph-based structural representation to capture the three-dimensional structural information of all reagents involved in the chemical reaction for machine learning purposes. Notably, the dataset employed comprises 1 million synthesis experiment records extracted and refined from research papers. To develop a highly accurate yield prediction model, I introduce a configuration that enhances model uncertainty in situations characterized by inconsistencies in experimental data. By quantifying the difficulty of the synthesis experiment through the deviation between the predicted yield value and the model based on learned patterns, this approach improves not only accuracy but also addresses issues related to bias and insufficient chemical reaction data, thereby surpassing previous studies in the field of synthesis experiment yield prediction. The final study aims to optimize the combination of reaction conditions by leveraging the condition generation model and synthesis difficulty quantifying model introduced earlier. The optimization strategy entails defining the exploration region of conditions based on the synthetic representation (reactants and product structures) using the generative model. The priority is then determined by the yield prediction model, leading to the identification of 10 initial combinations of reaction conditions. Subsequently, actual synthesis experiments are conducted using the selected conditions to measure the yields obtained. A surrogate model (Gaussian process) of the Bayesian optimization algorithm is trained solely on the yields derived from these synthesis experiments. Once the initial 10 experiments are completed, the results from the condition acquisition function and the Bayesian optimization, chosen as the machine learning-based yield prediction models, are combined to select the subsequent combination of conditions to be tested. The weights assigned to these two acquisition functions are adjusted by evaluating the deviation between the machine learning-based yield prediction model value and the actual yield value. This comprehensive approach ensures an efficient optimization strategy that takes into account the difficulty of synthesis while demonstrating its performance across various optimization models. In conclusion, this doctoral dissertation proposes an experiment optimization technique for exploring suitable conditions of organic synthesis experiments. It effectively reduces the exploration range and quantifies the difficulty of synthesis experiments, facilitating efficient exploration. The performance of the proposed approach is validated using real synthesis automation equipment.},

The extensive solubility data generated from the dissolution of various compounds under different conditions, is distributed across structured or semi-structured formats in various media, such as text, web pages, tables, images, and databases. These data exhibit multi-source and unstructured features, aligning with the typical 5 V characteristics of big data.

  abstract = {Machine learning techniques have numerous applications in modern drug discovery. Advances in computing power, machine learning algorithms and data availability have inspired renewed interest in artificial intelligence and automation in chemical synthesis. The field of Computer-Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP) aims to improve chemists' workflow by shortening the time required to synthesise compounds, giving them more time to analyse and design future experiments. In this thesis, we review contemporary CASP methodologies before developing machine learning models to predict reaction yield. State-of-the-art approaches to forward reaction prediction and retrosynthetic analysis tasks are outlined and compared using quantitative metrics. Predicting reaction yield is a newer aspect of CASP that has received significantly less attention than forward reaction prediction and retrosynthetic planning. This is owing, in part, to a lack of curated reaction data reporting reaction yield. Using a combinatorial benchmark dataset generated using high throughput experimentation, we evaluate machine learning models to predict reaction yield. Our research focuses on linear, tree-based, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine-learning algorithms. Chemical reactivity regression tasks frequently use molecular descriptors based on time-consuming, computationally demanding quantum chemical calculations. Along with quantum chemical descriptors, we investigate a range of topological representations that are quicker to calculate and applicable to all molecules. SVR emerges as the most promising machine learning model across all molecular descriptors in a preliminary crossvalidation test evaluating interpolation. Rigorous out-of-sample tests are designed to reliably assess the extrapolation capabilities of the most promising SVR models. The performance of SVR models built on topological representations surpasses those constructed on quantum chemical descriptors. The top SVR models built on each descriptor are subjected to additional validation. A collection of previously unseen perspective chemical reactions is compiled. Predictions are presented for synthetic assessment to validate and explore the extent of the generalisability of the top SVR models.},

Masked auto-encoder is one of the most common self-supervised pretext tasks used in molecular representation learning. However, previous masked auto-encoder based methods focus on learning the existence of compounds, which may not be sufficient for chemical understanding. In this paper, we present the Masked Molecule Modeling (MMM), an emerging self-supervised paradigm of molecular representation learning, which is a simple yet mighty pretext task by exploiting the contextualized chemical semantics in more than two million reactions. As a result, the molecular representations learned by MMM shows promising performance on a wide range of real-world tasks and significantly outperform existing methods, including biocatalysed synthesis planning, retrosynthesis planning, binding affinity, and molecular pharmacological property prediction for drug discovery.},

Conducted within the framework of the Datacc project (datacc.org) on research and data management, supported by Lyon and Grenoble Alpes University Libraries, our study fills the gap in literature on the disciplines concerned with reporting negative results in scholarly research. It shows that 81\% of the researchers surveyed have already produced relevant negative results and 75\% say they are willing to publish this type of data. However, only 12.5\% of respondents have had the opportunity to do so in a scientific journal.

In recent years, with big data generated by experiments and computing technology becoming increasingly accessible, data-driven solutions, especially machine learning methods have opened a new window for the discovery and rational design of eco-friendly functional materials. In this review, we first presented a brief introduction of functional materials, the most commonly used machine learning models and relevant processes. The applications of ML-based approaches and computational methods in functional prediction and material design were then summarized. More importantly, by combining machine learning methods with the toxicity prediction of functional materials, we proposed a framework for sustainable functional material design to achieve better functionality and eco-friendliness. Such a framework will ensure both the practicability and effectiveness of functional materials, balance their functionality and environmental sustainability, and eventually pave the path toward the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations.},

Therefore, intuitive ``grasping'' of descriptor spaces (latent vectors or classical) becomes paramount -- after learning to walk, we need to understand where to go. Fortunately, chemical cartography also progressed, notably with the development of Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). This chapter advocates connecting ``structure-descriptor-structure'' autoencoders to ``descriptor-landscape'' intuitive, predictive GTMs as a powerful de novo design strategy. GTM node coordinates preferentially populated by bioactives mark interesting neighborhoods from which autoencoders may extract novel promising structures. Autoencoder approaches may even apply to reactions (via the concept of condensed graphs of reaction). Decoding of latent vectors sampled in the vicinity of Suzuki reaction-populated nodes returned several examples of unexpected ``Suzuki-like'' processes, some of which could be confirmed a posteriori.},

But curating such information into datasets suitable for tasks such as yield and reaction outcome prediction is impractical via manual curation and not possible to automate through programmatic means alone. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as potent tools, showcasing remarkable capabilities in processing textual information and therefore could be extremely useful in automating this process. To address the challenge of unstructured data, we manually curated a dataset of structured chemical reaction data to fine-tune and evaluate LLMs. We propose a paradigm that leverages prompt-tuning, fine-tuning techniques, and a verifier to check the extracted information. We evaluate the capabilities of various LLMs, including LLAMA-2 and GPT models with different parameter counts, on the data extraction task. Our results show that prompt tuning of GPT-4 yields the best accuracy and evaluation results. Fine-tuning LLAMA-2 models with hundreds of samples does enable them and organize scientific material according to user-defined schemas better though. This workflow shows an adaptable approach for chemical reaction data extraction but also highlights the challenges associated with nuance in chemical information.

Comparison of different ligands revealed the 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane (P2N2) scaffold to be more broadly applicable than common ``gold standard'' ligands, demonstrating that this family of readily accessible diphosphines has unrecognized potential in organic synthesis. In particular, two structurally related P2N2 ligands were identified to enable the regiodivergent arylation of styrenes. By simply altering the phosphorus substituent from a phenyl to tert-butyl group, both the linear and branched Mizoroki--Heck products can be obtained in high regioisomeric ratios. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies were performed to further probe the origin of selectivity, which suggests that both ligands coordinate to the metal in a similar manner but that rigid positioning of the phosphorus substituent forces contact with the incoming olefin in a {$\pi$}--{$\pi$} interaction (for P-Ph ligands) or with steric clash (for P-tBu ligands), dictating the regiocontrol.},

While leveraging microbial metabolites derived from biological feedstocks possesses high potential in many avenues of chemical development, the applicability of this paradigm to the specifics of soft materials chemistry is unclear. Here, we construct a chemical reaction network based on databases of common microbial metabolites and the USPTO reaction set to examine what is possible in the chemical space of metabolite-derived chemistries of relevance to soft materials. We observe that the accessible chemical space of our chemical reaction network possesses strong microbe-specific chemical diversity and that this space saturates rapidly within three synthetic steps applied to the original microbial metabolites. Importantly, we show that the chemical space accessible from metabolite precursors possesses significant overlap with existing petrochemical building blocks, known and proposed synthetically feasible polymer monomers, and the chemical space of common organic semiconductors and redox active materials. The biases induced by the metabolite and reaction databases that parametrize our reaction network are analyzed as a function of chemical functional groups, and pathways toward broader sets of chemistries and reactions are outlined. This work introduces a computational framework for soft materials discovery with the potential to accelerate the identification of soft materials relevant to metabolic engineering targets and nonpetroleum sourcing pathways for existing soft materials.},

We improve the HTE data landscape with the disclosure of 39,000+ previously proprietary HTE reactions that cover a breadth of chemistry, including cross-coupling reactions and chiral salt resolutions. The high-throughput experimentation analyser was validated on cross-coupling and hydrogenation datasets, showcasing the elucidation of statistically significant hidden relationships between reaction components and outcomes, as well as highlighting areas of dataset bias and the specific reaction spaces that necessitate further investigation.},

  abstract = {Machine learning can make a strong contribution to accelerating the discovery of transition metal complexes (TMC). These compounds will play a key role in the development of new technologies for which there is an urgent need, including the production of green hydrogen from renewable sources. Despite the recent developments in machine learning for drug discovery and organic chemistry in general, the application of these methods to TMCs remains challenged by their higher complexity and the limited availability of large datasets. In this work, we report a representation for deep graph learning on TMCs -- the natural quantum graph (NatQG), which leverages the electronic structure data available from natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. This data was used to define both the topology and the information expressed by the NatQG graphs. At the topology level, two different NatQG flavors were developed: u-NatQG, with undirected edges, and d-NatQG, with edges directed along donor {$\rightarrow$} acceptor orbital interactions. At the information level, the node and edge attribute vectors of both graphs contain NBO data, including natural charges and bond orders. The NatQG graphs were used to develop graph neural networks (GNNs) for the prediction of the quantum properties underlying the structure and reactivity of TMCs (e.g. HOMO--LUMO gap and polarizability). These models surpassed baselines based on traditional descriptors and performed at a level similar to, or higher than, state-of-the-art GNNs based on radial cutoffs. The results showed that the electronic structure information encoded by the models has a stronger impact on its accuracy than the geometric information. With the aim of benchmarking the GNNs, we also developed the transition metal quantum mechanics graph dataset (tmQMg), which provides the geometries, properties, and NatQG graphs of 60k TMCs.},

The role of AI is increasingly significant in synthesizing and analyzing vast data, thus aiding in developing more efficient decarbonization strategies. {$\bullet$}	 Envisioning a digital and chemical analog to hackerspaces and makerspaces, we propose CreatorSpace, embedded in a larger dynamic world model, as a way to offer open access to tools for reasoning, computation, and data handling.

This culture could lead to breakthroughs in chemical technologies beyond the decarbonization challenge. Summary The pressing challenge of decarbonization encompasses a vast combinatorial space of interlinked technologies, thus necessitating an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted molecular modeling and data analytics. Our backcasting analysis proposes a future rich in efficient decarbonization technologies, such as sustainable fuels for aviation and shipping, as well as carbon capture and utilization. We then retrace the path to this proposed future with the guidance of two constraints: the maximization of scientists' creative capacities and the evolution of a world-centric AI. Our exploration leads us to the concept of a ``CreatorSpace,'' a distributed digital system resembling existing hackerspaces and makerspaces known for accelerating the prototyping of new technologies worldwide. The CreatorSpace serves as a virtual, semantic platform where chemists, engineers, and materials scientists can freely collaborate, integrating chemical knowledge with cross-scale, cross-technology tools, and operations.

  abstract = {One of the ultimate goals of chemistry is to understand and manipulate chemical reactions, which implies the ability to monitor the reaction and its underlying mechanism at an atomic scale. In this article, we introduce the Unified Reaction Valley Approach (URVA) as a tool for elucidating reaction mechanisms, complementing existing computational procedures. URVA combines the concept of the potential energy surface with vibrational spectroscopy and describes a chemical reaction via the reaction path and the surrounding reaction valley traced out by the reacting species on the potential energy surface on their way from the entrance to the exit channel, where the products are located. The key feature of URVA is the focus on the curving of the reaction path. Moving along the reaction path, any electronic structure change of the reacting species is registered by a change in the normal vibrational modes spanning the reaction valley and their coupling with the path, which recovers the curvature of the reaction path. This leads to a unique curvature profile for each chemical reaction, with curvature minima reflecting minimal change and curvature maxima indicating the location of important chemical events such as bond breaking/formation, charge polarization and transfer, rehybridization, etc. A decomposition of the path curvature into internal coordinate components or other coordinates of relevance for the reaction under consideration, provides comprehensive insight into the origin of the chemical changes taking place. After giving an overview of current experimental and computational efforts to gain insight into the mechanism of a chemical reaction and presenting the theoretical background of URVA, we illustrate how URVA works for three diverse processes, (i) [1,3] hydrogen transfer reactions; (ii) {$\alpha$}-keto-amino inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro; (iii) Rh-catalyzed cyanation. We hope that this article will inspire our computational colleagues to add URVA to their repertoire and will serve as an incubator for new reaction mechanisms to be studied in collaboration with our experimental experts in the field.},

Here, one crucial question is how to write molecules such that computers can easily process them. In this perspective, we analyze Selfies, a relatively young method for representing molecules in a computer. Since its invention 2 years ago, Selfieshas since simplified and enabled numerous workflows for artificial intelligence (AI) in chemistry and material science. We take an in-depth look into the future of Selfies and molecular string representations. We detail 16 new future research directions, ranging from new AI applications in chemistry, to the development of robust languages for large chemical domains, to questions about the readability of different chemical languages for humans and machines. Thereby, we hope to open a myriad of exciting doors with consequences in materials science and beyond. Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expanding in popularity for broad applications to challenging tasks in chemistry and materials science. Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery of new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to read and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular string representation, Smiles, has powered cheminformatics since the late 1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, Smiles has several shortcomings---most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\% robustness: SELF-referencing embedded string (Selfies). Selfies has since simplified and enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this perspective, we look to the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete future projects for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust languages, and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and materials science.},

Chemical reaction databases assist chemists in gaining insights into this process. Traditionally, searching for relevant records from a reaction database has relied on the manual formulation of queries by chemists based on their search purposes, which is challenging without explicit knowledge of what they are searching for. In this study, we propose an intelligent chemical reaction search system that simplifies the process of enhancing the search results. When a user submits a query, a list of relevant records is retrieved from the reaction database. Users can express their preferences and requirements by providing binary ratings for the individual retrieved records. The search results are refined based on the user feedback. To implement this system effectively, we incorporate and adapt contrastive representation learning, dimensionality reduction, and human-in-the-loop techniques. Contrastive learning is used to train a representation model that embeds records in the reaction database as numerical vectors suitable for chemical reaction searches. Dimensionality reduction is applied to compress these vectors, thereby enhancing the search efficiency. Human-in-the-loop is integrated to iteratively update the representation model by reflecting user feedback. Through experimental investigations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the chemical reaction search towards better alignment with user preferences and requirements.},

  abstract = {In synthesis planning, it is important to determine suitable reaction conditions such that a chemical reaction proceeds as intended. Recent research attempts based on machine learning have proven to be effective in recommending reaction elements for specific categories regarding critical chemical context and operating conditions. However, existing methods can only make a single prediction per reaction and do not directly provide a complete specification of the reaction elements as the prediction. Therefore, their achievable performance is limited. In this study, we propose a generative modeling approach to predict multiple different reaction conditions for a chemical reaction, each of which fully specifies critical reaction elements such that these elements can be directly used as a feasible reaction condition. We formulate the problem of predicting reaction conditions as sampling from a generative distribution. We model the distribution by introducing a variational autoencoder augmented with a graph neural network and learn it from a reaction dataset. For a query reaction, multiple predictions can be obtained by repeated sampling from the distribution. Through experimental investigation on the reaction datasets of four major types of cross-coupling reactions, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in retrieving ground-truth reaction conditions.},

  abstract = {This thesis focuses on computational reactivity analyses and predictions for organic systems. The research began with studies on specific reactions using quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics simulations. Beyond looking at individual reactions, projects in method development were also initiated to set up a more efficient and automated procedure for tackling the challenges of exploring the conformational space, investigating the effect of reaction dynamics and suggesting possible reaction pathways. Chapter 2 focuses on the selective pyridination of 5-methylcytosine. A new reaction mechanism that aligns with the experimental result was proposed. The variations in percentage yield upon changes in the substituent in the pyridine substrate can be explained by considering the thermodynamics and kinetics of the proton transfer step from cationic 5mdC{$\bullet$}+ to neutral pyridine substrates. Substrates with an electron-withdrawing group are disfavoured thermodynamically, while substrates with an electron-donating group face a high kinetic barrier in a key proton transfer step. Chapter 3 gives insights into the origin of enantioselectivity in 1,4-dicarbonyl synthesis reactions with diarylprolinol silyl ether catalysts via a radical pathway. A robust procedure has been developed for computational investigations of large and flexible chemical systems based on the conformation labelling system, ONIOM calculations and Python scripting. The change in enantiomeric excess due to variations in the catalyst can be explained based on conformational changes and structural deformations. In the enantioselectivity-determining radical addition step, the iminium in the lowest energy SR transition state (TS) takes up the conformation of the lowest energy ground state iminium (EE). The conjugated iminium in the SS TS adopts an EZ conformation to avoid potential structural deformations due to radical attacks from the more sterically hindered position. For systems with simpler catalysts, the iminium is EE for both, as the steric hindrance imposed by the substituent is not sufficient to cause this large structural deformation, and so the reaction shows poor enantioselectivity. Chapter 4 is on the development of the CONFPASS (Conformer Prioritisations and Analysis for DFT re-optimisations) Python package. CONFPASS extracts dihedral angle descriptors from conformational searching outputs, performs clustering, and returns a priority list for density functional theory (DFT) re-optimisations. Evaluations were conducted with DFT data of the conformers for 150 structurally diverse molecules, most of which are flexible. CONFPASS gives a confidence estimate that the global minimum structure has been found, and based on our dataset, we can have 90\% confidence after optimising half of the FF structures. Re-optimising conformers in order of the FF energy often generates duplicate results; using CONFPASS, the duplication rate is reduced by a factor of two for the first 30\% of the re-optimisations, which includes the global minimum structure about 80\% of the time. Chapter 5 details the study of a group of oxazaborolidinium ion-catalysed reactions between aldehyde and diazo compounds. Their selectivity cannot be explained using transition state theory. VRAI-selectivity, developed to predict the outcome of dynamically controlled reactions, can account for both the chemo- and the stereo-selectivity in these reactions, which are controlled by reaction dynamics. Subtle modifications to the substrate or catalyst substituents alter the potential energy surface, leading to changes in predominant reaction pathways and altering the barriers to the major product when reaction dynamics are considered. In addition, this study suggests an explanation for the mysterious inversion of enantioselectivity resulting from the inclusion of an ortho iPrO group in the catalyst. Chapter 6 presents a method for predicting reaction sites based only on a simple, two-bond model. Machine learning classification models were trained and evaluated using atom-level labels and descriptors, including bond strength and connectivity. Despite limitations in covering only local chemical environments, the models achieved over 80\% accuracy even with challenging datasets that cover a diverse chemical space. Whilst this simplistic model is necessarily incomplete, it describes a large amount of interesting chemistry and provides guidance on potential reaction pathways.},

Our findings demonstrate that LLMs produce fewer false reactions compared to existing datasets and reveal that many reactions in US patents involve multiple experimental steps, previously overlooked by standard extraction methods.

Further descriptor analysis helps understand reaction mechanisms behind the data. As a practical and robust toolbox, Reaxtica can be easily applied to different chemical reactions and extended to out-of-sample reaction.

  abstract = {Molecule-text modeling, which aims to facilitate molecule-relevant tasks with a textual interface and textual knowledge, is an emerging research direction. Beyond single molecules, studying reaction-text modeling holds promise for helping the synthesis of new materials and drugs. However, previous works mostly neglect reaction-text modeling: they primarily focus on modeling individual molecule-text pairs or learning chemical reactions without texts in context. Additionally, one key task of reaction-text modeling -- experimental procedure prediction -- is less explored due to the absence of an open-source dataset. The task is to predict step-by-step actions of conducting chemical experiments and is crucial to automating chemical synthesis. To resolve the challenges above, we propose a new pretraining method, ReactXT, for reaction-text modeling, and a new dataset, OpenExp, for experimental procedure prediction. Specifically, ReactXT features three types of input contexts to incrementally pretrain LMs. Each of the three input contexts corresponds to a pretraining task to improve the text-based understanding of either reactions or single molecules. ReactXT demonstrates consistent improvements in experimental procedure prediction and molecule captioning and offers competitive results in retrosynthesis.

However, traditional retrosynthesis predictions performed by chemists and rule-based expert systems struggle to adapt to the vast chemical space of real-world scenarios. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized retrosynthesis prediction in recent decades, significantly increasing the accuracy and diversity of predictions for target compounds. Single-step AI-driven retrosynthesis models can be generalized into three types based on their dependence on predefined reaction templates (template-based, semitemplate-based methods, template-free models), with respective advantages and limitations, and common challenges that limit their medicinal chemistry applications. Moreover, there are relatively inadequate multi-step retrosynthesis methods, which lack strong links with single-step methods. Herein, we review the recent advancements in AI applications for retrosynthesis prediction by summarizing related techniques and the landscape of current representative retrosynthesis models and propose feasible solutions to tackle existing problems and outline future directions in this field.},

The main contribution of this work is to formulate multiple dif-ferent chemical problems as language processing tasks. This is made possible by using atransformer-based model that intakes molecules represented by text notations. First, we willdescribe in detail how we built a unified deep learning model T5Chem based on "Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer" (T5) framework to handle a variety of reaction predictions tasks,including generation, regression and classification with open-sourced reaction data. Since theT5 model itself is a black-box model, we will introduce a molecule fragmentation strategyto explain T5Chem predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). Lastly, theapplicability of our unified model is extended to pKa prediction. Pre-trained with PubChemmolecules, our model shows good performance on several benchmark datasets.The basic philosophy of my work is that different chemical problems are internally related.By making use of pre-training, we built an explainable unified model that is versatile.

To represent such procedures, there is a well-structured language, named chemical description language ({$\chi$}DL). While automated conversion methods from text to {$\chi$}DL using either a rule-based approach or a generative large language model (GLLM) have been proposed, they sometimes produce errors. Therefore, human review following an automated conversion is essential to obtain an accurate {$\chi$}DL. The aim of this work is to visualize embedded information in the original text with a structured format to support the understanding of human reviewers. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for editing automatically converted {$\chi$}DLs from the literature with annotated text. In addition, we introduce a rule-based conversion method. To improve the quality of automated conversions, a method of using two candidate {$\chi$}DLs with different characteristics was proposed: one generated by the proposed rule-based method and the other by an existing GLLM-based method. In an experiment involving six organic synthesis procedures, we confirmed that showing the outputs of both systems to the user improved recall compared with showing one output individually.},

Users can access online reagent data, such as a chemical inventory, to virtually populate wells with experiments and produce instructions to perform the reaction array manually, or with the assistance of a liquid handling robot. After completion of the reaction array, analytical results can be uploaded for facile evaluation, and to guide the next series of experiments. All chemical data, metadata, and results are stored in machine-readable formats that are readily translatable to various software. We also demonstrate the use of phactor™ in the discovery of several chemistries, including the identification of a low micromolar inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, phactor™ has been made available for free academic use in 24- and 96-well formats via an online interface.},

Traditional medicinal chemistry programs rely on a few, well-developed reactivities to create pharmacophore derivatives and synthetic routes to target scaffolds. While reactions such as the amide coupling and Suzuki coupling are robust and tolerate many substrates, they introduce bias into chemical properties by limiting synthesis to a handful of bond formations, narrowing the scope and flexibility of chemical structures that can be formed from available building block compounds. Through computational enumeration, specific transformations can be targeted that direct access to specific and desirable chemical space. With high throughput experimentation and data science, these transformations can be invented and optimized experimentally to realize high value chemistries and accelerate drug discovery.

  abstract = {Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a hackathon. This article chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon. Participants employed LLMs for various applications, including predicting properties of molecules and materials, designing novel interfaces for tools, extracting knowledge from unstructured data, and developing new educational applications. The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines.},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen an explosion of machine learning in chemistry. Whether it is in property prediction, synthesis, molecular design, or any other subdivision, machine learning seems poised to become an integral, if not a dominant, component of future research efforts. This extraordinary capacity rests on the interac- tion between machine learning models and the underlying chemical data landscape commonly referred to as chemical space. Chemical space has multiple incarnations, but is generally considered the space of all possible molecules. In this sense, it is one example of a molecular set: an arbitrary collection of molecules. This thesis is devoted to precisely these objects, and particularly how they interact with machine learning models. This work is predicated on the idea that by better understanding the relationship between molecular sets and the models trained on them we can improve models, achieve greater interpretability, and further break down the walls between data-driven and human-centric chemistry. The hope is that this enables the full predictive power of machine learning to be leveraged while continuing to build our understanding of chemistry. The first three chapters of this thesis introduce and reviews the necessary machine learning theory, particularly the tools that have been specially designed for chemical problems. This is followed by an extensive literature review in which the contributions of machine learning to multiple facets of chemistry over the last two decades are explored. Chapters 4-7 explore the research conducted throughout this PhD. Here we explore how we can meaningfully describe the properties of an arbitrary set of molecules through information theory; how we can determine the most informative data points in a set of molecules; how graph signal processing can be used to understand the relationship between the chosen molecular representation, the property, and the machine learning model; and finally how this approach can be brought to bear on protein space. Each of these sub-projects briefly explores the necessary mathematical theory before leveraging it to provide approaches that resolve the posed problems. We conclude with a summary of the contributions of this work and outline fruitful avenues for further exploration.},

Despite the appearance of steady progress, we argue that imperfect benchmarks and inconsistent comparisons mask systematic shortcomings of existing techniques, and unnecessarily hamper progress. To remedy this, we present a synthesis planning library with an extensive benchmarking framework, called SYNTHESEUS, which promotes best practice by default, enabling consistent meaningful evaluation of single-step and multi-step synthesis planning algorithms. We demonstrate the capabilities of SYNTHESEUS by re-evaluating several previous retrosynthesis algorithms, and find that the ranking of state-of-the-art models changes in controlled evaluation experiments. We end with guidance for future works in this area, and call on the community to engage in the discussion on how to improve benchmarks for synthesis planning.},

  abstract = {Drug discovery follows a design-make-test cycle of proposing drug compounds, synthesising them, and measuring their bioactivity, which informs the next cycle of compound designs. The challenges associated with each step lead to the long timeline of preclinical pharmaceutical development. This thesis focuses on how we can use machine learning tools to accelerate the design-make-test cycle for faster drug discovery. We begin with the design of new compounds, looking at the initial stage of fragment-based hit finding where only the 3D coordinates of fragment-protein complexes are available. The standard approach is to ``grow'' or ``merge'' nearby fragments based on their binding modes, but fragments typically have low affinity so the road to potency is often long and fraught with false starts. Instead, we can reframe fragment-based hit discovery as a denoising problem - identifying significant pharmacophore distributions from an ``ensemble'' of fragments amid noise due to weak binders - and employ an unsupervised machine learning method to tackle this problem. We construct a model that screens potential molecules by evaluating whether they recapitulate those fragment-derived pharmacophore distributions. We show that this approach outperforms docking in distinguishing active compounds from inactive ones on historical data. Further, we prospectively find novel hits for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the Mac1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 by screening a library of 1 billion molecules. After identifying hit compounds, we enter the hit-to-lead stage where we wish to optimise their molecular structures to improve bioactivity. Framing bioactivity modelling as active/inactive classification would not allow us to rank compounds based on predicted bioactivity improvement, while the low number of active compounds and the measurement noise make a regression approach challenging. We overcome this challenge with a learning-to-rank framework via a classifier that predicts whether a compound is more or less active than another using the difference in molecular descriptors between the molecules as input. This allows us to make use of inactive data, and threshold the bioactivity differences above measurement noise. Validation on retrospective data for Mpro shows that we can outperform docking on ranking ligands, and we prospectively screen a library of 8.8M molecules and arrive at a potent compound with a novel scaffold. Throughout the entire course of drug discovery, one needs to find a synthesis route to actually make the molecule. An exciting approach is to use deep learning models trained on patent reaction databases, but they suffer from being opaque black boxes. It is neither clear if the models are making correct predictions because they inferred the salient chemistry, nor is it clear which training data they are relying on to reach a prediction. To address this issue, we developed a workflow for quantitatively interpreting a state-of-the-art deep learning model for reaction prediction. By analysing chemically selective reactions, we show examples of correct reasoning by the model, explain counterintuitive predictions, and identify Clever Hans predictions where the correct answer is reached for the wrong reason due to dataset bias. Testing a drug candidate typically involves obtaining a pure sample of the molecule, and then measuring its bioactivity in solution via an assay. While necessary for maximum accuracy, compound purification can be time-consuming and costly. We investigated whether we needed compound purification at all for training machine learning bioactivity models by assaying crude reaction mixtures instead of pure samples. This approach allowed us to obtain bioactivity data in higher throughput and train useful models for the identification of false negative assay measurements, as well as prospective screens. The research presented in this thesis highlights the promise of applying machine learning in accelerating the design-make-test cycle of drug discovery. This thesis concludes by outlining promising research directions for applying machine learning within drug discovery.},

Such big data need to be standardized, curated, preserved, and disseminated in a way that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to make use of its full potential. The materials science community is in its premature stage concerning adapting research data management (RDM) practices. In this work, we provide detailed recommendations to be followed within the data-driven research life cycle, which aims to promote RDM within the community. More interoperable materials databases and standards need to be developed and adopted within the community to get the maximum benefit from this initiative. The nature of heterogeneous data in materials science makes this a huge challenge. However, if we all, as a community, work together to make our data FAIR, materials discovery could indeed be accelerated. Summary The need for good research data management (RDM) practices is becoming more recognized as a critical part of research. This may be attributed to the 5V challenge in big data: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value. The materials science community is no exception to these challenges as it heralds its new paradigm of data-driven science, which uses artificial intelligence to accelerate materials discovery but requires massive datasets to perform effectively. Hence, there are efforts to standardize, curate, preserve, and disseminate these data in a way that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). To understand the current state of data-driven materials science and learn about the challenges faced with RDM, we gather user stories of researchers from small- and large-scale projects. This enables us to provide relevant recommendations within the data-driven research life cycle to develop and/or procure an effective RDM system following the FAIR guiding principles.

Currently, the majority of publicly available data is reported in an unstructured format and heavily imbalanced toward high-yielding reactions, which influences the types of models that can be successfully trained. In this Perspective, we analyze several data curation and sharing initiatives that have seen success in chemistry and molecular biology. We discuss several factors that have contributed to their success and how we can take lessons from these case studies and apply them to reaction data.

The wave function files were generated through DFT static calculations (B3LYP/6-31G), and the atomic properties were calculated using QTAIM. The calculated atomic properties include the energy of the atomic basin, the electronic population, the magnitude of the total dipole moment, and the magnitude of the total quadrupole moment. The atomic properties allow one to understand the chemical structure, reactivity, and molecular recognition. They can be incorporated into force fields for molecular dynamics or for predicting reactive sites.

  abstract = {With advancements in computational power and increased data availability, machine learning (ML) has been applied in predicting chemical reactions and proposing synthetic pathways. This thesis contributes to advancing chemical reaction discovery through ML across three primary domains. Initially, computational methods were used to analyze transition states in reaction routes generated by the Sarpong group using Synthia™, evaluating their computational feasibility. Then, industrial electronic lab notebook (ELN) data, supported by AZ, were processed and featurized. Various ML techniques, including Random Forests (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Neural Networks (NN), and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), were applied to predict reaction yields. Yield imbalances in HTE and ELN were addressed to enhance yield prediction in critical regions using imbalanced regression methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) were integrated for data extraction, solving inconsistencies in USPTO datasets from multiple sources, and investigating the intricate information space of reaction procedure through a specific study on t-butyl ester deprotection. In the second part, substantial advancements were achieved in Molecular Representation Learning (MRL) to accurately capture molecular structures and physical behavior. By evaluating 3D GNNs and conformer ensemble-based models, this research extends beyond traditional SMILES, fingerprints, and 2D molecular graphs, enhancing the precision of predictions for molecule and reaction-level properties. These improvements are crucial for tasks such as enantiomeric excess (ee) selectivity prediction and binding energy (BE) prediction studies.},

Considering borylation as a critical step in late-stage functionalization, the computational model predicted reaction yields for diverse reaction conditions with a mean absolute error margin of 4--5\%, while the reactivity of novel reactions with known and unknown substrates was classified with a balanced accuracy of 92\% and 67\%, respectively. The regioselectivity of the major products was accurately captured with a classifier F-score of 67\%.

Nevertheless, their chemical intricacy often poses challenges in predicting reactivity for C-H activation reactions and planning their synthesis. We adopted a reaction screening approach that combines high-throughput experimentation (HTE) at a nanomolar scale with computational graph neural networks (GNNs). This approach aims to identify suitable substrates for late-stage C-H alkylation using Minisci-type chemistry. GNNs were trained using experimentally generated reactions derived from in-house HTE and literature data. These trained models were then used to predict, in a forward-looking manner, the coupling of 3180 advanced heterocyclic building blocks with a diverse set of sp3-rich carboxylic acids. This predictive approach aimed to explore the substrate landscape for Minisci-type alkylations. Promising candidates were chosen, their production was scaled up, and they were subsequently isolated and characterized. This process led to the creation of 30 novel, functionally modified molecules that hold potential for further refinement. These results positively advocate the application of HTE-based machine learning to virtual reaction screening.},

This format enables chemists to record the synthesis of molecules in a format that is understandable by both humans and machines, which facilitates seamless sharing and integration directly into machine learning pipelines. SURF files are designed to be interoperable, easily imported into relational databases, and convertible into other formats. This complements existing initiatives like the Open Reaction Database (ORD) and Unified Data Model (UDM). At Roche, SURF plays a crucial role in democratizing FAIR reaction data sharing and expediting the chemical synthesis process.},

The chemical system is converted into a computer-readable language through the use of molecular representations and descriptors. Databases are crucial for the development of ML predictive models in molecular synthesis, but they still largely lack open-access, scale, and structured chemical databases, particularly with respect to unsuccessful experimental data. The synergy between experimentation and ML allows a significant acceleration of reaction optimization. The rapid exploration of the chemical space through deep learning makes it an efficient strategy for the assembly of viable molecules in molecular synthesis. Deep neural networks can assist in the choice of retrosynthesis planning, minimizing unreasonable synthetic operations. Progress has been made on the human-free autonomous development of highly efficient chemical reactions in molecular synthesis. Abstract The recent synergy of machine learning (ML) with molecular synthesis has emerged as an increasingly powerful platform in organic synthesis and catalysis. This merger has set the stage for key advances in inter alia reaction optimization and discovery as well as in synthesis planning. The creation of predictive ML models relies on chemical databases, molecular descriptors, and the choice of the ML algorithms. Chemical databases provide a crucial support of chemical knowledge contributing to the development of an accurate and generalizable ML model. Molecular descriptors translate the chemical structure into digital language, so that substrates or catalysts in molecular synthesis and catalysis are represented in a numerical fashion. ML algorithms achieve an effective mapping between the molecular descriptors and the target properties, enabling an efficient prediction based on readily available or calculated descriptors. Herein, we highlight the key concepts and approaches in ML and their major potential towards molecular synthesis with emphasis in catalysis, pointing out additionally the most successful cases in the field.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including natural language processing, robotic control, and more recently, chemistry. Despite significant advancements in standardizing the reporting and collection of synthetic chemistry data, the automatic reproduction of reported syntheses remains a labour-intensive task. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based chemical research agent workflow designed for the automatic validation of synthetic literature procedures. Our workflow can autonomously extract synthetic procedures and analytical data from extensive documents, translate these procedures into universal XDL code, simulate the execution of the procedure in a hardware-specific setup, and ultimately execute the procedure on an XDL-controlled robotic system for synthetic chemistry. This demonstrates the potential of LLM-based workflows for autonomous chemical synthesis with Chemputers. Due to the abstraction of XDL this approach is safe, secure, and scalable since hallucinations will not be chemputable and the XDL can be both verified and encrypted. Unlike previous efforts, which either addressed only a limited portion of the workflow, relied on inflexible hard-coded rules, or lacked validation in physical systems, our approach provides four realistic examples of syntheses directly executed from synthetic literature. We anticipate that our workflow will significantly enhance automation in robotically driven synthetic chemistry research, streamline data extraction, improve the reproducibility, scalability, and safety of synthetic and experimental chemistry.},

We need to utilize them to better stratify patients into risk groups, discover new biomarkers and targets, repurpose known and discover new drugs to personalize medical treatment. Existing methodologies are limited and a paradigm shift is needed to achieve quantitative and qualitative breakthroughs.In this perspective paper, we survey the literature and argue for the development of a comprehensive, general framework for embedding of multi-scale molecular network data that would enable their explainable exploitation in precision medicine in linear time. Network embedding methods (also called graph representation learning) map nodes to points in low-dimensional space, so that proximity in the learned space reflects the network's topology--function relationships. They have recently achieved unprecedented performance on hard problems of utilizing few omic data in various biomedical applications. However, research thus far has been limited to special variants of the problems and data, with the performance depending on the underlying topology--function network biology hypotheses, the biomedical applications, and evaluation metrics. The availability of multi-omic data, modern graph embedding paradigms and compute power call for a creation and training of efficient, explainable and controllable models, having no potentially dangerous, unexpected behaviour, that make a qualitative breakthrough. We propose to develop a general, comprehensive embedding framework for multi-omic network data, from models to efficient and scalable software implementation, and to apply it to biomedical informatics, focusing on precision medicine and personalized drug discovery.

  abstract = {The advent of digitized, large-scale, and high-throughput technologies has generated unprecedented data, presenting an excellent opportunity for today's drug discovery program to leverage machine learning (ML). By identifying relevant problems and suitable formulations in ML, we can translate these ever-increasing data into discovering better drugs and shorten the drug development cycles leading to cheaper drug and therapeutic options for previously incurable diseases. In this dissertation, we present four ML methods to tackle different challenges in today's drug discovery pipeline to quickly deliver more viable drug candidates for the clinical trial and eventually improve the quality of life for all humans. First, we introduce a batch equalization method that leverages style-transfer generative adversarial networks to mediate the batch effect commonly found in cellular images such that we can use them more effectively for high-throughput in vitro screening. Second, we describe an energy-inspired SE(3)-equivariant model to efficiently and accurately estimate the distribution of molecular conformations such that we can improve the accuracy for in silico structured-based screening. Third, we propose a 3D full-atom diffusion framework for target-aware molecule generation such that we can explore new chemistry beyond existing screening libraries and propose novel drug candidates for binding targets of challenging diseases. Fourth, we describe a reaction prediction algorithm that brings together rule-based systems (integer linear programming) and data-driven approaches (graph neural network) such that we can use efficiently synthesize drug candidates from the described screening pipeline or generative models. In the end, we use a graph neural network to model odorant molecules (instead of drugs) and find a universal odor space shared by many species. We hypothesize that the biology of metabolism drives such convergent evolution, and our ability to model these volatile organic compounds related to different metabolic processes could have great implications on how we understand animal olfaction and study human health. Put together, this dissertation shows the potential of machine learning to transform drug discovery and human health in the era of big data.},

In this work, we detail the evaluation of AbbVie's medicinal chemistry library data set to build machine learning models for the prediction of Suzuki coupling reaction yields. The combination of density functional theory (DFT)-derived features and Morgan fingerprints was identified to perform better than one-hot encoded baseline modeling, furnishing encouraging results. Overall, we observe modest generalization to unseen reactant structures within the 15-year retrospective library data set. Additionally, we compare predictions made by the model to those made by expert medicinal chemists, finding that the model can often predict both reaction success and reaction yields with greater accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this approach to suggest structurally and electronically similar building blocks to replace those predicted or observed to be unsuccessful prior to or after synthesis, respectively. The yield prediction model was used to select similar monomers predicted to have higher yields, resulting in greater synthesis efficiency of relevant drug-like molecules.},

  abstract = {The application of mechanistic generalizations is at the core of chemical reaction development and application. These strategies are rooted in physical organic chemistry where mechanistic understandings can be derived from one reaction and applied to explain another. Over time these techniques have evolved from rationalizing observed outcomes to leading experimental design through reaction prediction. In parallel, significant progression in asymmetric organocatalysis has expanded the reach of chiral transfer to new reactions with increased efficiency. However, the complex and diverse catalyst structures applied in this arena have rendered the generalization of asymmetric catalytic processes to be exceptionally challenging. Recognizing this, a portion of our research has been focused on understanding the transferability of chemical observations between similar reactions and exploiting this phenomenon as a platform for prediction. Through these experiences, we have relied on a working knowledge of reaction mechanism to guide the development and application of our models which have been advanced from simple qualitative rules to large statistical models for quantitative predictions. In this feature article, we describe the models acquired to generalize organocatalytic reaction mechanisms and demonstrate their use as a powerful approach for accelerating enantioselective synthesis.},

  abstract = {Automated experimental systems, which provide a means to accelerate scientific research and the discovery of application-driven materials, are specialized and limited in scope. The inability to pivot to new research areas has driven a shift in design to create generalized systems and incorporate decision logic to grant systems autonomy. The incorporation of autonomy enables flexible and adaptable operation but complicates automation. In this thesis, autonomy for operation execution and workflow design was integrated into an automated platform for molecular discovery. This integration required adapting control architectures to handle goal-oriented commands, advancing scheduling strategies to orchestrate concurrent and evolving workflows, and developing modular interfaces to facilitate workflow mutation and the incorporation of real-time decision logic. For control, a master controller orchestrated platform tasks while a separate database provided platform instruments with current information on samples, workflows, and platform resources. This enabled executive control through high-level commands which could be translated into concrete actions by the agent at run-time using current platform information and available instrument capabilities. For scheduling, a greedy algorithm was developed to handle the simultaneous execution of multiple workflows with temporal constraints between tasks and whose tasks and operational details could change. This provided a way to accommodate the adaptability and agency of the platform's systems, ensure sample integrity, and prevent resource and operational conflicts. Workflows were designed with modular, high-level tasks and were self-contained to allow platform agents to mutate the workflow without requiring knowledge of other workflows or the implementation-level details of other agents' operations. Hardware modules utilized an inverted modular design whereby each task they were programmed to accomplish was injected into their parent controller rather than every controller enforcing a standard set of operations on their children. This enabled every agent to make flexible use of its decision logic with access to a suite of context-specific commands. Further exploring the ideas of autonomy, an algorithm was developed to assist the platform in selecting alternative reaction conditions to improve reaction yields. The data-driven approach imitates a chemist by considering conditions from related reactions then evaluating trust in those conditions by the number and quality of successful reactions that are similar to these related reactions to determine new conditions},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting structured data from scientific literature, but their use in chemistry faces unique challenges due to the complex, variable nature of experimental procedures. Here, we present a dual-LLM framework that combines an LLM-as-Judge to evaluate data extraction quality with an LLM-as-Optimizer to refine evaluation prompts systematically. To evaluate the performance, we leverage a manually annotated dataset of over 800 reaction steps in an action-centric schema that captures the sequential nature of chemical procedures rather than relying on rigid key-value pairs that are conventionally used. Through systematic analysis of various parameters, including temperature settings and prompt structures, we identify optimal configurations that maximize agreement with expert chemists while minimizing computational costs. The framework shows good agreement with expert annotations while reducing manual prompt engineering effort. This systematic approach not only demonstrates how modern machine learning techniques can address fundamental challenges in scientific data extraction but also provides a reusable pipeline for evaluating extraction results across domains where experimental variability has historically limited the development of standardized evaluation metrics.},

Regrettably, there are three major gaps, fine-grained domain-specific knowledge injection, heterogeneity between human knowledge and robot instructions, and diversity of users' preferences, resulting automation system design a case-by-case and labour-intensive effort, thus hindering the democratization of automation. We refer to this challenging alignment as the abstract hardware grounding problem, where we firstly regard the procedural operations in humans' semantics space as the abstraction of hardware requirements, then we ground such abstractions to instantiated hardware devices, subject to constraints and preferences in the real world---optimizing this problem is essentially standardizing and automating the design of automation systems. On this basis, we develop an automated design framework in a hybrid data-driven and principle-derived fashion. Results on designing self-driving laboratories for enhancing experiment-driven scientific discovery suggest our framework's potential to produce compact systems that fully satisfy domain-specific and user-customized requirements with no redundancy.},

However, the transition of experimental protocols, originally crafted for human comprehension, into formats interpretable by machines presents significant challenges, which, within the context of specific expert domain, encompass the necessity for structured as opposed to natural language, the imperative for explicit rather than tacit knowledge, and the preservation of causality and consistency throughout protocol steps. Presently, the task of protocol translation predominantly requires the manual and labor-intensive involvement of domain experts and information technology specialists, rendering the process time-intensive. To address these issues, we propose a framework that automates the protocol translation process through a three-stage workflow, which incrementally constructs Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that approach structured on the syntax level, completed on the semantics level, and linked on the execution level. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have demonstrated its performance at par with that of human experts, underscoring its potential to significantly expedite and democratize the process of scientific discovery by elevating the automation capabilities within self-driving laboratories.},

This review introduces the basic constituents of ML, including databases, features, and algorithms, and highlights a few important achievements in chemistry that have been aided by ML techniques. The described databases include some of the most popular chemical databases for molecules and materials obtained from either experiments or computational calculations. Important two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) features representing the chemical environment of molecules and solids are briefly introduced. Decision tree and deep learning neural network algorithms are overviewed to emphasize their frameworks and typical application scenarios. Three important fields of ML in chemistry are discussed: \ding{172} retrosynthesis, in which ML predicts the likely routes of organic synthesis; \ding{173} atomic simulations, which utilize the ML potential to accelerate potential energy surface sampling; and \ding{174} heterogeneous catalysis, in which ML assists in various aspects of catalytic design, ranging from synthetic condition optimization to reaction mechanism exploration. Finally, a prospect on future ML applications is provided.},

In this work, we propose ReLM, a novel framework that leverages the chemical knowledge encoded in language models (LMs) to assist GNNs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of real-world chemical reaction predictions. To further enhance the model's robustness and interpretability, we incorporate the confidence score strategy, enabling the LMs to self-assess the reliability of their predictions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ReLM improves the performance of state-of-the-art GNN-based methods across various chemical reaction datasets, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

Recently, machine learning (ML) has shown promise in accelerating the development of newer catalytic protocols. However, the need for large amount of experimental data can present a bottleneck for implementing ML models. Here, we propose a meta-learning workflow that can harness the literature-derived data to extract shared reaction features and requires only a few examples to predict the outcome of new reactions. Prototypical networks are used as a meta-learning method to predict the enantioselectivity of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. This meta-learning model consistently provides significant performance improvement over other popular ML methods such as random forests and graph neural networks. The performance of our meta-model is analyzed with varying sizes of training examples to demonstrate its utility even with limited data. A good model performance on an out-of-sample test set further indicates the general applicability of our approach. We believe this work will provide a leap forward in identifying promising reactions in the early phases of reaction development when minimal data is available.},

Here, a machine-learning framework is developed that predicts stressor-specific stability scores from computationally generated reaction data. The thermal degradation of alkanes was studied as an exemplary system to demonstrate the approach. The half-lives of {$\sim$}32k alkanes were simulated under pyrolysis conditions using 59 model reactions. Using a hinge-loss function, these half-life data were used to train machine learning models to predict a scalar representing the relative stability based only on the molecular graph. These models were successful in transferability case studies using distinct training and testing splits to recapitulate known stability trends with respect to the degree of branching and alkane size. Even the simplest models showed excellent performance in these case studies, demonstrating the relative ease with which thermal stability can be learned. The stability score is also shown to be useful in a design study, where it is used as part of the objective function of a genetic algorithm to guide the search for more stable species. This work provides a framework for converting kinetic reaction data into stability scores that provide actionable design information and opens avenues for exploring more complex chemistries and stressors.},

The column loading method ensures that the product breaking through a fully loaded first column is loaded onto the second one, avoiding waste of precious material and technological complexity associated with the use of four-to-six columns typical of simulated moving bed chromatography. The system was applied to synthesize biphenyl via Suzuki--Miyaura reaction, and was also demonstrated for other structurally-different compounds. Compared to the discontinuous and other traditional approaches, our method leads to higher isolated yields (ca. +60\%), higher productivity (ca. +30\%), and reduced solvent consumption (ca. -80\%).

Conversely, quantum chemical data for molecular systems remains largely fragmented across individual datasets, lacking the comprehensive framework of a unified database. We distilled insights from these existing data resources into seven guiding principles termed QUANTUM, which build upon the foundational FAIR principles of data sharing (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). These principles are aimed at advancing the development of molecular databases into robust, integrated data platforms. We conclude with an outlook on both short- and long-term objectives, guided by these QUANTUM principles, to foster future advancements in molecular quantum databases and enhance their utility for the research community.},

Accounting for catalyst stability under working conditions is challenging but achievable by a combination of high-throughput computations and machine learning. {$\bullet$}	 Autonomous computations should be complemented by autonomous laboratories, which allow high-throughput experimentation and catalyst optimization through machine learning but require large investments from research facilities. Summary Autonomous atomistic computations are excellent tools to accelerate the development of heterogeneous (electro-)catalysts. In this perspective, we critically review the achieved progress to accelerate high-throughput screening aimed at identifying promising catalyst materials via databases, workflow managers, and machine-learning techniques. Outstanding challenges are also discussed extensively: the modification and stability of catalyst surfaces under realistic reaction conditions is key for meaningful predictions. Furthermore, adequately accounting for solvent effects remains a topic of active research particularly relevant for biomass transformations and electrocatalysis. Finally, efficient, autonomous workflows for investigating active sites of amorphous catalysts remain underdeveloped. The computations can also be supplemented with autonomous laboratories, which allow the performance of sophisticated experiments driven by artificial intelligence-augmented design of experiments, reducing human-time investment for optimizing synthesis and reaction conditions as well as catalyst characterizations. The combination of autonomous computations and laboratories promise to power the dearly needed transition to a sustainable chemical industry.

The analysis involved applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with VADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32\% of video descriptions were positive, 36.63\% were neutral, and 14.05\% were negative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in pandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91\% of content as toxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed two main themes, with 66.74\% of the videos covering general health information and pandemic-related impacts and 33.26\% focused on news and real-time updates, highlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system was also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by sentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned video recommendations. This system achieved 69\% aggregate coverage, with monthly coverage rates consistently above 85\%, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed coverage reaching 69\% for five video recommendations and 79\% for ten video recommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for understanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that supports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content related to COVID-19.},

The past decade has witnessed significant momentum in harnessing data science concepts in catalysis research to aid the aforementioned cause. Here we comprehensively review how catalysis practitioners have leveraged data-driven strategies to solve complex challenges across heterogeneous, homogeneous and enzymatic catalysis. We delineate all studies into deductive or inductive modes, and statistically infer the prevalence of catalytic tasks, model reactions, data representations and choice of algorithms. We highlight frontiers in the field and knowledge transfer opportunities among the catalysis subdisciplines. Our critical assessment reveals a glaring gap in data science exploration in experimental catalysis, which we bridge by elaborating on four pillars of data science, namely descriptive, predictive, causal and prescriptive analytics. We advocate their adoption into routine experimental workflows and underscore the importance of data standardization to spur future research in digital catalysis.},

A solution to this challenge would have significant practical applications in areas ranging from drug design to atmospheric chemistry. However, in order to address this challenge, many issues need to be overcome including the lack of open data, the combinatorial and physical complexity of chemical reactions, and the need for interpretable solutions that illuminate the underlying reaction mechanisms. We will describe three projects aimed at addressing these challenges including the development and deployment of public databases of chemical reaction steps, and the development and training of deep graph neural network and transformer architectures to predict reaction outcomes in interpretable ways.},

  abstract = {Most online chemical reaction databases are not publicly accessible or are fully downloadable. These databases tend to contain reactions in noncanonicalized formats and often lack comprehensive information regarding reaction pathways, intermediates, and byproducts. Within the few publicly available databases, reactions are typically stored in the form of unbalanced, overall transformations with minimal interpretability of the underlying chemistry. These limitations present significant obstacles to data-driven applications including the development of machine learning models. As an effort to overcome these challenges, we introduce PMechDB, a publicly accessible platform designed to curate, aggregate, and share polar chemical reaction data in the form of elementary reaction steps. Our initial version of PMechDB consists of over 100,000 such steps. In the PMechDB, all reactions are stored as canonicalized and balanced elementary steps, featuring accurate atom mapping and arrow-pushing mechanisms. As an online interactive database, PMechDB provides multiple interfaces that enable users to search, download, and upload chemical reactions. We anticipate that the public availability of PMechDB and its standardized data representation will prove beneficial for chemoinformatics research and education and the development of data-driven, interpretable models for predicting reactions and pathways.

RMechDB contains over 5,300 elementary radical reaction steps, each with a single transition state at or around room temperature. These elementary step reactions are manually curated plausible arrow-pushing steps for organic radical reactions. The steps were taken from a variety of sources. Over 2,000 mechanistic steps were extracted from textbooks and/or constructed from research publications. Another 3,000 were taken from gas-phase atmospheric reactions of isoprene and other organic molecules on the MCM (Master Chemical Mechanism) Web site. Reactions are encoded in the SMIRKS format with accurate atom mapping and annotations for arrow-pushing mechanisms. At its core, RMechDB consists of a database schema with an online interactive search interface and a request portal for downloading the raw form of elementary step reactions with their metadata. It also offers an interface for submitting new reactions to RMechDB and expanding the data set through community contributions. Although there are several applications for RMechDB, it is primarily designed as a central platform of radical elementary steps with a unified and structured representation. We believe that this open access to this data and platform enables the extension of data-driven models for chemical reaction predictions and other chemoinformatics predictive tasks.},

Recent work has shown the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for the self-optimization of chemical reactions; however, in all previous cases these algorithmic procedures have started with no prior information about the reaction of interest. In this work, we explore the use of multitask Bayesian optimization (MTBO) in several in silico case studies by leveraging reaction data collected from historical optimization campaigns to accelerate the optimization of new reactions. This methodology was then translated to real-world, medicinal chemistry applications in the yield optimization of several pharmaceutical intermediates using an autonomous flow-based reactor platform. The use of the MTBO algorithm was shown to be successful in determining optimal conditions of unseen experimental C--H activation reactions with differing substrates, demonstrating an efficient optimization strategy with large potential cost reductions when compared to industry-standard process optimization techniques. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the methodology as an enabling tool in medicinal chemistry workflows, representing a step-change in the utilization of data and machine learning with the goal of accelerated reaction optimization.},

This procedure is often kept long into a researcher's career, as new recipes are developed based on similar reaction protocols, and intuition-guided deviations are conducted through learning from failed experiments. However, when attempting to understand chemical systems of interest, it has been shown that model-based, algorithm-based, and miniaturized high-throughput techniques outperform human chemical intuition and achieve reaction optimization in a much more time- and material-efficient manner; this is covered in detail in this paper. As many synthetic chemists are not exposed to these techniques in undergraduate teaching, this leads to a disproportionate number of scientists that wish to optimize their reactions but are unable to use these methodologies or are simply unaware of their existence. This review highlights the basics, and the cutting-edge, of modern chemical reaction optimization as well as its relation to process scale-up and can thereby serve as a reference for inspired scientists for each of these techniques, detailing several of their respective applications.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 served as a catalyst for content creation and dissemination on social media platforms, as such platforms serve as virtual communities where people can connect with one another seamlessly. While there have been several works related to the mining and analysis of COVID-19related posts on social media platforms such as Twitter (or X), YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok, there is still limited research that focuses on the public discourse about COVID-19 on Instagram. Furthermore, the prior works in this field have only focused on the development and analysis of datasets of Instagram posts published during the first few months of the outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes three scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 500,153 Instagram posts about COVID19 published between January 2020 and September 2024. This dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/d46p-v480, contains Instagram posts in 161 different languages, and these posts contain 535,021 distinct hashtags. After the development of this dataset, multilingual sentiment analysis was performed, which involved classifying each post as positive, negative, or neutral. The results of sentiment analysis are presented as a separate attribute in this dataset. Second, the paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis per year from 2020 to 2024. The findings revealed the trends in sentiment related to COVID-19 on Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. For instance, between 2020 and 2024, the sentiment trends show a notable shift, with positive sentiment decreasing from 38.35\% to 28.69\%, while neutral sentiment increasing from 44.19\% to 58.34\%. Finally, the paper also presents findings of language-specific sentiment analysis. This analysis highlighted similar and contrasting trends of sentiment across posts published in different languages on Instagram. For instance, out of all English posts, 49.68\% were positive, 14.84\% were negative, and 35.48\% were neutral. In contrast, among Hindi posts, 4.40\% were positive, 57.04\% were negative, and 38.56\% were neutral, reflecting distinct differences in the sentiment distribution between these two languages.},

During different virus outbreaks of the past, such as COVID-19, Influenza, Lyme Disease, and Zika virus, researchers from various disciplines utilized Google Trends to mine multimodal components of web behavior to study, investigate, and analyze the global awareness, preparedness, and response associated with these respective virus outbreaks. As the world prepares for Disease X, a dataset on web behavior related to Disease X would be crucial to contribute towards the timely advancement of research in this field. Furthermore, none of the prior works in this field have focused on the development of a dataset to compile relevant web behavior data, which would help to prepare for Disease X. To address these research challenges, this work presents a dataset of web behavior related to Disease X, which emerged from different geographic regions of the world, between February 2018 and August 2023. Specifically, this dataset presents the search interests related to Disease X from 94 geographic regions. These regions were chosen for data mining as these regions recorded significant search interests related to Disease X during this timeframe. The dataset was developed by collecting data using Google Trends. The relevant search interests for all these regions for each month in this time range are available in this dataset. This paper also discusses the compliance of this dataset with the FAIR principles of scientific data management. Finally, an analysis of this dataset is presented to uphold the applicability, relevance, and usefulness of this dataset for the investigation of different research questions in the interrelated fields of Big Data, Data Mining, Healthcare, Epidemiology, and Data Analysis with a specific focus on Disease X.},

The recent outbreak of the Marburg Virus disease (MVD), the high fatality rate of MVD, and the conspiracy theory linking the FEMA alert signal in the United States on 4 October 2023 with MVD and a zombie outbreak, resulted in a diverse range of reactions in the general public which has transpired in a surge in web behavior in this context. This resulted in ``Marburg Virus'' featuring in the list of the top trending topics on Twitter on 3 October 2023, and ``Emergency Alert System'' and ``Zombie'' featuring in the list of top trending topics on Twitter on 4 October 2023. No prior work in this field has mined and analyzed the emerging trends in web behavior in this context. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes multiple scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents the results of performing time-series forecasting of the search interests related to MVD emerging from 216 different regions on a global scale using ARIMA, LSTM, and Autocorrelation. The results of this analysis present the optimal model for forecasting web behavior related to MVD in each of these regions. Second, the correlation between search interests related to MVD and search interests related to zombies was investigated. The findings show that there were several regions where there was a statistically significant correlation between MVD-related searches and zombie-related searches on Google on 4 October 2023. Finally, the correlation between zombie-related searches in the United States and other regions was investigated. This analysis helped to identify those regions where this correlation was statistically significant.},

  abstract = {Text-based foundation models have become an important part of scientific discovery, with molecular foundation models accelerating advancements in molecular design and materials science. However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers which capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirty tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, for their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation language, revealing significant gaps. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by training and fine-tuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics. The proposed tokenizer framework systematically integrates nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; this facilitates applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage.},

  abstract = {Effective synthesis planning powered by deep learning (DL) can significantly accelerate the discovery of new drugs and materials. However, most DL-assisted synthesis planning methods offer either none or very limited capability to recommend suitable reaction conditions (RCs) for their reaction predictions. Currently, the prediction of RCs with a DL framework is hindered by several factors, including: (a) lack of a standardized dataset for benchmarking, (b) lack of a general prediction model with powerful representation, and (c) lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we first created 2 standardized RC datasets covering a broad range of reaction classes and then proposed a powerful and interpretable Transformer-based RC predictor named Parrot. Through careful design of the model architecture, pretraining method, and training strategy, Parrot improved the overall top-3 prediction accuracy on catalysis, solvents, and other reagents by as much as 13.44\%, compared to the best previous model on a newly curated dataset. Additionally, the mean absolute error of the predicted temperatures was reduced by about 4 {$^\circ$}C. Furthermore, Parrot manifests strong generalization capacity with superior cross-chemical-space prediction accuracy. Attention analysis indicates that Parrot effectively captures crucial chemical information and exhibits a high level of interpretability in the prediction of RCs. The proposed model Parrot exemplifies how modern neural network architecture when appropriately pretrained can be versatile in making reliable, generalizable, and interpretable recommendation for RCs even when the underlying training dataset may still be limited in diversity.},

Here, the history of developing AI-aided synthesis has been overviewed and summarized. We propose that the hardware of AI-controlled synthesis systems should be more adaptive to execute reactions with different phase reagents and under different reaction conditions, and the software of AI-controlled synthesis systems should have richer kinds of reaction prediction modules.

Following that, we specifically discuss large language models in retrosynthesis planning.

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods have great potential to transform chemical discovery by accelerating the exploration of chemical space and drawing scientific insights from data. However, modern chemical reaction ML models, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs), must be trained on a large amount of labelled data in order to avoid overfitting the data and thus possessing low accuracy and transferability. In this work, we propose a strategy to leverage unlabelled data to learn accurate ML models for small labelled chemical reaction data. We focus on an old and prominent problem---classifying reactions into distinct families---and build a GNN model for this task. We first pretrain the model on unlabelled reaction data using unsupervised contrastive learning and then fine-tune it on a small number of labelled reactions. The contrastive pretraining learns by making the representations of two augmented versions of a reaction similar to each other but distinct from other reactions. We propose chemically consistent reaction augmentation methods that protect the reaction center and find they are the key for the model to extract relevant information from unlabelled data to aid the reaction classification task. The transfer learned model outperforms a supervised model trained from scratch by a large margin. Further, it consistently performs better than models based on traditional rule-driven reaction fingerprints, which have long been the default choice for small datasets, as well as those based on reaction fingerprints derived from masked language modelling. In addition to reaction classification, the effectiveness of the strategy is tested on regression datasets; the learned GNN-based reaction fingerprints can also be used to navigate the chemical reaction space, which we demonstrate by querying for similar reactions. The strategy can be readily applied to other predictive reaction problems to uncover the power of unlabelled data for learning better models with a limited supply of labels.},

Herein, we present ORDerly, an open-source Python package for the customizable and reproducible preparation of reaction data stored in accordance with the increasingly popular Open Reaction Database (ORD) schema. We use ORDerly to clean United States patent data stored in ORD and generate data sets for forward prediction, retrosynthesis, as well as the first benchmark for reaction condition prediction. We train neural networks on data sets generated with ORDerly for condition prediction and show that data sets missing key cleaning steps can lead to silently overinflated performance metrics. Additionally, we train transformers for forward and retrosynthesis prediction and demonstrate how non-patent data can be used to evaluate model generalization. By providing a customizable open-source solution for cleaning and preparing large chemical reaction data, ORDerly is poised to push forward the boundaries of machine learning applications in chemistry.},

Everyone working with molecules, whether chemist or not, needs an understanding of the representation of molecules in a machine-readable format, as this is central to computational chemistry. Four classes of representations are introduced: string, connection table, feature-based, and computer-learned representations. Three of the most significant representations are simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES), International Chemical Identifier (InChI), and the MDL molfile, of which SMILES was the first to successfully be used in conjunction with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to yield a continuous representation of molecules. This is noteworthy because a continuous representation allows for efficient navigation of the immensely large chemical space of possible molecules. Since 2018, when the first model of this type was published, considerable effort has been put into developing novel and improved methodologies. Most, if not all, researchers in the community make their work easily accessible on GitHub, though discussion of computation time and domain of applicability is often overlooked. Herein, we present questions for consideration in future work which we believe will make chemical VAEs even more accessible. This article is categorized under: Data Science {$>$} Chemoinformatics},

Due to a backlog of decades and an increasing amount of printed literatures, there is a high demand for translating printed depictions into machine-readable formats, which is known as Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR). Most OCSR systems developed over the last three decades use a rule-based approach, which vectorizes the depiction based on the interpretation of vectors and nodes as bonds and atoms. Here, we present a practical software called MolMiner, which is primarily built using deep neural networks originally developed for semantic segmentation and object detection to recognize atom and bond elements from documents. These recognized elements can be easily connected as a molecular graph with a distance-based construction algorithm. MolMiner gave state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark data sets and a self-collected external data set from scientific papers. As MolMiner performed similarly well in real-world OCSR tasks with a user-friendly interface, it is a useful and valuable tool for daily applications.

In this study, we curated the Photocatalysis Database (PhotoCatDB), which consists of 6,523 photocatalytic reactions (of which 6,175 are multicomponent) containing reaction condition information such as photocatalysts, bases or acids, additives, and solvents. Before adding reaction conditions to the training data, the attention-based deep learning model PhotoCat pre-trained on USPTO and fine-tuned on PhotoCatDB had a Top-1 accuracy of 78.16\%, which was 77.70\% higher than the same model trained only on the USPTO database and 14.53\% higher than the model fine-tuned by the photocatalytic reactions from Reaxys. After adding reaction conditions to the training data, the Top-1 accuracy of PhotoCat was further increased to 82.25\%. In addition, the interpretability of the model was reflected in its attention weights, which can infer the model's understanding of photocatalytic chemistry. Furthermore, five previously unreported photocatalytic reactions predicted by PhotoCat were successfully validated by wet-lab experiments, demonstrating the potential of the model in identifying and verifying novel photocatalysis reactions of real-world significance.},

This work proposes and implements a scheme to build a reaction data set labeled with the reaction class for reactions from reactive molecular dynamics simulations using ReaxFF (ReaxFF MD) in generating global reactions in pyrolysis of realistic fuel mixtures. The major steps include the automated conversion of reactions into elementary-like reactions with a pseudosingle reaction center, automatic extraction of extended reaction centers, reaction class defining, and manual labeling. There are 46 reaction classes defined in total based on both pyrolysis reaction knowledge and reaction observations from ReaxFF MD simulations of realistic hydrocarbon fuel pyrolysis. With the effort to have as adequate number of reactions as possible labeled for each reaction class defined, 7862 reactions were manually labeled with reaction classes for the data set of 26,881 elementary-like reactions that cover major pyrolysis reaction classes of typical hydrocarbon fuel components of n-paraffins, iso-paraffins, olefins, cycloparaffins, and aromatics. The reaction data set has been used in the scheme of SRG-Reax to build a semisupervised machine learning model of tri-training to predict the reaction classes of pyrolysis reactions. Through automated reaction classification, 30 major reaction classes involved in a total of 3479 pyrolysis reactions of real RP-3 fuel containing 45 components unravel the overall pyrolysis reaction characteristics of the fuel system. With additional reaction classes defined and reaction data labeled, the approach can be used for various fuels.},

  abstract = {Organic synthesis stands as a cornerstone of the chemical industry. The development of robust machine learning models to support tasks associated with organic reactions is of significant interest. However, current methods rely on hand-crafted features or direct adaptations of model architectures from other domains, which lack feasibility as data scales increase or ignore the rich chemical information inherent in reactions. To address these issues, this paper introduces RAlign, a novel chemical reaction representation learning model for various organic reaction-related tasks. By integrating atomic correspondence between reactants and products, our model discerns the molecular transformations that occur during the reaction, thereby enhancing comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have designed an adapter structure to incorporate reaction conditions into the chemical reaction representation, allowing the model to handle various reaction conditions and to adapt to various datasets and downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce a reaction-center-aware attention mechanism that enables the model to concentrate on key functional groups, thereby generating potent representations for chemical reactions. Our model has been evaluated on a range of downstream tasks. Experimental results indicate that our model markedly outperforms existing chemical reaction representation learning architectures on most of the datasets. We plan to open-source the code contingent upon the acceptance of the paper.},

The main challenges are two-fold: firstly, most chemical data and scientific knowledge are stored in structured databases, which limits the model's ability to sustain coherent dialogue when used directly. Secondly, there is an absence of objective and fair benchmark that encompass most chemistry tasks. Here, we introduce ChemLLM, a comprehensive framework that features the first LLM dedicated to chemistry. It also includes ChemData, a dataset specifically designed for instruction tuning, and ChemBench, a robust benchmark covering nine essential chemistry tasks. ChemLLM is adept at performing various tasks across chemical disciplines with fluid dialogue interaction. Notably, ChemLLM achieves results comparable to GPT-4 on the core chemical tasks and demonstrates competitive performance with LLMs of similar size in general scenarios. ChemLLM paves a new path for exploration in chemical studies, and our method of incorporating structured chemical knowledge into dialogue systems sets a new standard for developing LLMs in various scientific fields.

One of the stop-gaps in understanding catalytic effects, which is often ignored and limits the deployment of data science tools, relates to the lack of uniform data. The catalytic cleavage of C--X (X= H, C, N, and O) bonds is relevant to many fundamental catalytic processes. In this Perspective, we performed data analytics on four groups of C--X cleavage reactions that are common in production, upcycling, or reactive separation: the C--C cleavage in cyclopropyl alcohol, the C--H cleavage in hydroacylation reactions, the C--O cleavage in {$\beta$}-O-4 linkages, and the C--N cleavage in amides, using experimental data collected from the literature to understand their underlying correlations. Experimental variables of high impact are identified for each reaction by dimensionality reduction methods. We highlight the urgent need for experimental data sets that include full details on the reaction conditions, such as reagent concentration, reaction temperature, or time in machine-readable forms. We discuss the potential improvement of the data of these reactions and promising approaches such as autonomous experiments to fill the gaps in unbiased experimental data. We also address the early stage consideration of separation aspects in the experimental design of efficient catalytic systems for these fundamental examples of chemical reactivity.},

This study explored the power of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) on five intricate chemical text mining tasks: compound entity recognition, reaction role labelling, metal--organic framework (MOF) synthesis information extraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) data extraction, and the conversion of reaction paragraphs to action sequences. The fine-tuned LLMs demonstrated impressive performance, significantly reducing the need for repetitive and extensive prompt engineering experiments. For comparison, we guided ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-4 with prompt engineering and fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo as well as other open-source LLMs such as Mistral, Llama3, Llama2, T5, and BART. The results showed that the fine-tuned ChatGPT models excelled in all tasks. They achieved exact accuracy levels ranging from 69\% to 95\% on these tasks with minimal annotated data. They even outperformed those task-adaptive pre-training and fine-tuning models that were based on a significantly larger amount of in-domain data. Notably, fine-tuned Mistral and Llama3 show competitive abilities. Given their versatility, robustness, and low-code capability, leveraging fine-tuned LLMs as flexible and effective toolkits for automated data acquisition could revolutionize chemical knowledge extraction.},

  abstract = {Computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) accelerates the development of organic synthetic pathways of complex functional molecules. CASP tools are usually developed from organic synthetic chemistry rules or the reaction data. However, synthetic biology offers a new degree of freedom through the ability to develop new synthetic steps. In this PhD thesis, a method for hybridising conventional organic and synthetic biological reaction datasets is presented to guide synthesis planning. Part of the organic reactions from the Reaxys database was combined with the metabolic reactions from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to create a hybrid dataset. The combined dataset was used to assemble synthetic pathways from multiple building blocks to a target molecule. Route assembly was performed using reinforcement learning, which was adapted to learn the values of molecular structures in synthetic planning and to develop a policy model to propose near-optimal multistep synthetic routes from the pool of available historical reactions. To quantify the added value of synthetic-biological reaction transformations in hybrid pathways, three policy model "decision makers" were developed from the organic, biological, and hybrid reaction pools, respectively. The near-optimal synthetic pathways predicted from the three reaction pools were evaluated and compared to discuss the advantages of synthetic chemical and synthetic biological reaction hybrid decision space in optimising reaction pathways. The hybrid pathways show that biochemical transformations may allow significant gains in syntheses efficiency, but yet, there is a limited access to biochemical reaction data, which limits the opportunity to find alternatives and synergies with organic synthesis. Hence, a workflow to explore the sparse synthetic biological domain was proposed. Learned from the biocatalytic transformations of recorded reactions, feasible biosynthetic reactions were proposed to expand KEGG reaction dataset by four folds. To catalyse the novel reactions, a transformer model learned from the reaction SMILES and amino acid sequences of native enzymes to predict promiscuous enzymes for potential substrates. The proposed transformer model calibrates the feasibility of the predicted reactions and reduces the search scope for promiscuous enzymes in the pool. The hybrid pathways also show the organic reactions are noisy, with a major issue of missing reaction co-participants in the reaction records. A heuristic-based method was developed to identify the balanced reactions from reaction databases, and complete some imbalanced reactions by adding candidate molecules. A machine learning masked language model was trained to learn from the reaction SMILES sentences of these completed reactions. The model predicted missing molecules for the incomplete reactions, analogous to predicting missing words in sentences. The model was promising to predict small and middle size missing molecules for incomplete reactions. The thesis presents an idea of hybridising organic chemical and synthetic biological reactions and delivers workflows towards a cleaner and more comprehensive hybrid reaction space to guide molecular synthesis. With the thesis presented methods, the research of CASP could be accelerated, and we could aim for more sustainable and efficient molecular synthesis routes.},

  abstract = {Chemical synthesis, as a foundational methodology in the creation of transformative molecules, exerts substantial influence across diverse sectors from life sciences to materials and energy. Current chemical synthesis practices emphasize laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows, underscoring the urgent need for advanced AI assistants. Nowadays, large language models (LLMs), typified by GPT-4, have been introduced as an efficient tool to facilitate scientific research. Here, we present Chemma, a fully fine-tuned LLM with 1.28 million pairs of Q\&A about reactions, as an assistant to accelerate organic chemistry synthesis. Chemma surpasses the best-known results in multiple chemical tasks, e.g., single-step retrosynthesis and yield prediction, which highlights the potential of general AI for organic chemistry. Via predicting yields across the experimental reaction space, Chemma significantly improves the reaction exploration capability of Bayesian optimization. More importantly, integrated in an active learning framework, Chemma exhibits advanced potential for autonomous experimental exploration and optimization in open reaction spaces. For an unreported Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of cyclic aminoboronates and aryl halides for the synthesis of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-Aryl N-heterocycles, the human-AI collaboration successfully explored suitable ligand and solvent (1,4-dioxane) within only 15 runs, achieving an isolated yield of 67\%. These results reveal that, without quantum-chemical calculations, Chemma can comprehend and extract chemical insights from reaction data, in a manner akin to human experts.

  abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) techniques to model high-throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets has seen a recent rise in popularity. Nevertheless, the ability to model the interplay between reaction components, known as interaction effects, with ML remains an outstanding challenge. Using a simulated HTE dataset, we find that the presence of irrelevant features poses a strong obstacle to learning interaction effects with common ML algorithms. To address this problem, we propose a two-part statistical modeling approach for HTE datasets: classical analysis of variance of the experiment to identify systematic effects that impact reaction yield across the experiment followed by regression of individual effects using chemistry-informed features. To illustrate this methodology, we use our previously published alcohol deoxyfluorination dataset comprising 740 reactions to build a compact, interpretable generalized additive model that accounts for each significant effect observed in the dataset. We achieve a sizeable performance boost compared to our previously published random forest model, reducing mean absolute error from 18 to 13\% and root-mean-squared error from 22 to 17\% on a newly generated validation set. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can facilitate the generation of new mechanistic hypotheses, which, when probed experimentally, can lead to a deeper understanding of chemical reactivity.},
